PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξς 5, 6.

Ιι. quem ad modum consueverunt. This is said in Cicero's
own person ς otherwise it would be ‘ consueverint!

a. huiusce, ‘of' my client? Cp. ξ 55 ‘huiusce pecunia’ and
‘hisce' in ἐξ 51, 59.

b. sunt. sexagies. Supply ‘ centenorum millium sestertiorum.'
Sixty times a hundred thousand = six millions. A practical rule
for expressing sesterces in English is to cut off a naught from
decies, or any multiple of decies, and add millions. Taking
the sesterce at 2735d„ six million sesterces is equivalent to {53,650.
Plutarch (Cic. 3) puts the value of the property down at 250
talents, which amounts to fi5z‚500‚ if the talent be taken at (210.

c. quem honoris causa nomino. A constantly recurring for-
mula of respect. Cp. §§ 15, 27 3 Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ξ 18—‘nonne‚
quotienscunque in causa in nomen huius incidisti, totiens hunc et
virum bonum esse dixisti et honoris causa appellasti? ’ The oppo-
site idea is conveyed by the phrase ‘ contumeliae causa nominare.’
Phil. II, ξ 113—‘ista tua minime avara coniux, quam ego sine
contumelia. describo? The natural politeness of the Romans ren-
dered them shy of making free with people's names, For an
indication of this feeling, see ξ 47.

d. nummum = ‘nummorum,’ i. e. ‘sestertiorum.' 2000 ses—
terces = ,4³17 145. 2d. Plutarch (Cic. 3) inaccurately substitutes
drachmae for sesterces. 2000 drachmae would be about five times
as much as 2000 sesterces 3 but either sum would be merely nominal
for a property of the value just stated. “

e. vel potentissimus, ‘perhaps the most powerful.' Cp. ξ, 8
‘vel indignissimum,’ § 21 ‘vel nobilissima,' ξ 69 ‘vel maxime‚'
ξ 124 ‘vel maximam partem.’

f. L. Cornelius Chrysogonus. A freedman and favourite of
Sulla, whose gentile name he took on manumission. Appian (De
Bell. Civ. I. 100) informs us that Sulla manumitted more than
10,000 slaves of proseribed persons, and enrolled them among the
plebs, selecting the youngest and strongest‚ that he might have a
serviceable body of men ready to do his bidding. All these took the
name Cornelius. Pliny the elder (N. H. xxxv, 200, ed. Detlefsen)
mentions Chrysogonus in a list of quondam slaves who had been
glutted with the blood of citizens.

g. pecuniam, ‘property.’ Cp. ἐξ 23, 86, 110; Verr. ii. II, 561.
The Scholiast says ‘id est, in alienum patrimonium. Pecuniam
dicit universitatem rei familiaris.’ The word in this sense may be
used in the pl., as in Pro Mil. 5 76. The derivation of it (from
‘ pecus ’) carries us back to an age when wealth consisted in cattle.
