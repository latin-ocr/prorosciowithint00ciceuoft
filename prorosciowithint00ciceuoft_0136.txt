PRO SEX. ROSCIO, NOTES. ἕξ 55, 56.

ᾗ 72; Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ξ 18—‘ quid tu, Saturi, qui contra hunc
venis’ ; also Phil. ΙΙ, ξ 3.

d. Ita tamen . . . ut, etc. ‘ However desirous of gain you may
be, still you ought to have thought that the opinion of these men and
the Remmian law ought to count for something.’ For this use of
‘ita . . . ut' cp. below, ‘ita est utile, ut,’ etc., and ἐξ 2, 4, 72, 73,
95, 124, 125, 129 ad in„ 148 ad fin.; Phil. II, § 85—‘ita eras
Lupercus, ut te consulem esse meminisse deberes,’ and Cicero
passim.

e. horum existimationem, ‘what these men think of you'-—
subjective genitive; not ⁴ what people think of these men ’—objective
genitive. So in Verr. ii. Ι, § 87—‘si te magnitudo maleficii, si
hominum existimatio ’ (the opinion of the world) ‘non movebat';
and again in ξ 93—‘ en memoriam mortui sodalis, en metum vivorum
existimationis?

f. legem Remmiam. This was a law by which a penalty was
instituted, if an accuser sailed to establish his charge. Scholiast.
Cp. Digest XLVIII. 16, ξς 1, 2-‘Calumniatoribus poena lege
Remmia irrogatur;' cp. XXII. 5, ξ 13.

g. ita est utile, ut, ‘is of service only under the condition that!

- See note above, ‘ita tamen . . . ut,’ etc.

ξ 56.

Ιι. ut, ne. See ξ 5d. The combination of both particles occurs
specially, as here, after ‘ ita.' Cp. Pro Q. 5 85—‘ita possideto, ut
Quinctio vis ne adferatur.’ It is possible to explain it by an ellipse,
as= ‘ ut caveatur ne.'

i. quispiam. ὁ δεῖνα, ‘ so and so.’

j. abest a culpa.. Cp. § 94——‘ longe absum ab eiusmodi crimine.’

k. criminose ac suspitiose, ‘so as to justisy a charge and raise
suspicion.' Cp. 5 76. Cicero deemed this faculty compatible with
very meagre abilities. See Brut. ξ 1 31—‘N on fecissem hominis
paene infimi mentionem, nisi iudicarem qui suspitiotius aut crimino-
sius diceret audivisse me neminem.'

l. ludificari. In Pro Q. § 54 we have the act. form ‘ ludificare.'

m. calumniari, ‘to bring a salse accusation.' Digest XLVIII. 16,
ξ 1-‘ Calumniari est falsa crimina intendere.' Cp. Verr. ii. Ι. 27
ad fin.—‘ calumniatores ex sinu suo apposuit)

a. utilius est, etc. The sentiment is—‘ It is less detrimental to the
state that innocent men should be brought to trial than that the
guilty should not.’ This is so only on condition of the innocent
being acquitted, so that ‘ absolvi ’ is substituted sor ‘ causam dicere,’
which it implies. It must be remembered that there was no such
thing as a public prosecutor under the Roman Republic.
