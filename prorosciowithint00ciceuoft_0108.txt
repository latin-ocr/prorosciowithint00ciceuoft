PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ῥῷ 11-13.

had presided before as judex in the ‘quaestio inter sicarios' before
the long interval during which trials had been suspended.

c. quaestioni, ‘ court.'

d. iudex, i. e. as ‘iudex quaestionis? Cp. Verr. ii. 1, ς 158; Pro
Clu. ξ 89. A ‘ iudex quaestionis' was a special commissioner ap-
pointed when the praetors were insufficient for the various ‘ quaesti-
ones.' The designation occurs in the Digest XLVIII. 8, ς 1—‘ quive
magistratus iudexve quaestionis ob capitalem causam pecuniam acce—
perit.’

e. talem. Observe how much force is added by keeping the
‘ antecedent ' clause to the close.

f. aeria. ac severa. . . . flant, ‘ should be conducted with strict-
ness and impartiality.' Cp. ξ 8 ‘ severitatem.'

g. longo intervallo. See Introd. ς 24.

lz. inter sicarios, ‘this is the first trial that is being held for
murder.’ Cp. 5 90 ‘ qui inter sicarios et de veneficiis accusabant!

ε’. hoc primum. See Introd. ξ 21.

j. committitur. On the analogy of the phrase ‘pugnam com—
mittere.'

k. dimissius. The text is corrupt ; ‘dimissui’ gives a conceivable
sense, ‘serve to release us from ²: but no such word as ‘ dimissus ’ of
the 4th decl. ever actually occurs. The reading ‘dignissimam ' is
conjectural.

, a. vociferatione, ‘that energy of denunciation.' Cp. § 9

‘ vociferari.'

h. qui causam dicimus, ‘who are the defendam) Cp. the
repeated antithesis in ξ 13 between ‘ accusant ’ and ‘causam dicit)
Since Cicero’s case was that the murder was committed by the
opposite side, while nominally defending his client, he was virtually
attacking the accusers.

c. quam acerrime, ‘with all possible strictness.’ In full—‘ ut
tam acriter quam quum acerrime vindicantur, maleficia vindicetis?

d. prorumpere, ⁴ the passions of men are bursting forth.'

e. ut non modo clam, etc. A splendid instance of ‘ climaX‚' in
the loose sense of the term (see ξ 75 c). Cp. Livy XXIII. 10, ξ 7—-
‘ Foro medio, luce clara, videntibus vobis‚’ perhaps imitated by
Macaulay (Death os Virginia)—

‘Here in this very forum, under the noontide sun,
In sight of all the people, the bloody deed was done.’

a. invaserunt. See ξ 6 lz.

b. quibus . . . bono fuit. See ξ 84 g.

c. poscit, ‘ demands for trial.'
