PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ςκῤ 56-58.

b. Anseribus . . . locantur, ‘ public contracts are made for the
feeding of the geese.' It was the duty of the censors to make
these contractS, Plin. N. H. X. 51. See the story in Livy V.
47 of how the Capitol was saved by the sacred geese of Juno,
B.c. 390.

c. at. Anticipating an objection—‘ but you will say.’

d. crura suffringantux. The mutilation of the lower animals is
revolting to our ideas, But this form of punishment was sometimes
extended to human beings. A man whose legs had thus been broken
was called ‘ crurifragius‚' Plaut. Poen. iv. 2. 64.

e. quod aeres sint, ‘ for being on the alert.’ In the subjunctive,
because not stated as a fact, but as an idea.

a. Simulima . . . ratio. ‘ The case is very much the same with ξ 57,
accusers!

b. maxime . . . deinde. Like the Greek μάλιστα μέν . . . εἶ δὲ
μή, ‘ in the first instance . . . failing that)

c. commisisse. Used absolutely.

d. latratote. See ξ 18 g.

e. agetis . ›. . adfigent. Two contemporaneous events in the
future, cp. ξ 10 b. ‘ Agetis ’ is strictly an imperfect future, ‘ shall be
dealing!

f. litteram illam. The words of Cicero suggest the inference
that false accusers were branded with the letter K, standing sor
‘ calumniator‚' but there is no trace to be found of any such custom.
The Scholiast explains the Kas standing for ‘condemnoz ’ in case of
acquittal A would be used, for ‘absolvo' The allusion to the
Kalends‚ sor which K would also stand, is a hit at the impe-
cuniosity of men like Erucius, as interest was paid on the first of
the month. There is probably a ‘ double entendre' in the words
‘ad caput adfigent'—(1) attach to your status, (2) clap on to
your heads. Altogether the passage is one of the ‘quaedam paulo
hilariora,' to which Cicero alludes in his Orator (ξ 108).

g. vos, Referring to the class of professional accusers.

Ιι. omnis. .Acc. with ‘ Kalendas?

i. fortunas. In this sense of ‘luck ’ the plural is not so common
as when the word means ‘ wealth.’ See ξ 7 c. For a parallel to
the present use take Pro Q. ς 64 ‘ei misero, absenti, ignaro
fortunarum sua1·um,’ where the last words recall the ‘ignarum casus
sui ’ of this speech, ξ 98.

j. accusare possitis. Digest XLVIII. 2, ξ 4—‘ sed et calumnia
notatis ius accusandi ademptum est.'

a. Audio. See ς 52 c. We may render it here ‘ Indeed.' ξ 58,
