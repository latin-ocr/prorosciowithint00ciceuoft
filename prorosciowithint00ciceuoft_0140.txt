conveyed by ‘ certus,’ see Pro Q. 5 11—‘ officia certi patris familias‚’
i.e. one with an established position.

ε’. cum multa, etc. The ‘ cum ' is rhetorically repeated before
we come to its answering ‘tum-² ‘Not ronly the commission of
many previous crimes, not only a most abandoned life on the
person's part, but also, etc.' Cp. Verr. ii, 1, 5 41 ad fin. Sometimes
it is the ‘tum ’ that is repeated, as in 5 151 of the same.

j. expressa. This may be taken with ‘ exstent '—‘ should stand
out clear.’ On ‘ expressuss see 5 47 h. ’

k. sceleris vestigia. The extemal presumptions of guilt, as
opposed to the internal which have been mentioned.

l. admissum, ‘ committed.’ The full form of the phrase is
‘ admittere in se maleficium.’

‚ α. reclamitat. ἅπαξ εἰρημένον.

b. esse aliquem, ‘ that there should exist a being? ‘ Esse quem—
quam ' would imply that such a being did not exist, not merely that
its existence was a prodigy.

c. propter quos, ‘owing to whom.' ‘Propter’ here denotes
the efficient cause. Cp. 5 16; Pro Q. 5 70—‘ Alfenus cum eis et
propter eos periit, quos diligebat ; ’ Pro Mil. 5 93. Contrast its use
below in 5 64.

d. indignissime, ‘ most ungratefully.‘

e. conciliet. The verb is made to agree only with the last of
the three subjects. 1t cannot here be said that the several words
constitute one idea.

, a. Non ita multis, etc. Like the English ‘not so many years

ago.’ Cp. 5 78 ‘neque ita multo post3’ Pro Q. 5 14—‘ neque ita
commode posset rationem reddere3 ' Phil. ΙΙ, 5 108—‘ erant fortasse
gladii, sed absconditi nec ita multi!

b. ¹1¹. Caelium. Valerius Maximus (viii. 1, 5 13) tells the story
aster Cicero, as he did that of Fimbria (5 33).

c. Tarracinensem. Tarracina was a town in Latium earlier
known as Anxur. The pl. of the name was also used. Liv. IV. 59
—‘ Anxur fuit, quae nunc Tarracinae sunt.¹

d. cenatus. ‘ Ceno,' ‘ prandeo‚’ ‘poto’ are instances of verbs
which are deponent only in their participles.

e. servus quisquam. ‘ Quisquam ' is substantive, ‘ servus? ad—
jective, cp. 5 74 g. ”

f. id aetatis, ‘ of such an age‚’ referring to the word ‘ adulescen—
tibus.’ If they were children, they might have been supposed capa·
ble of sleeping through anything. For the form of expression, cp.
‘id temporis' ξ 97 ad fin.
