PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾗῇ 4, 5.

left it open tothem (‘ ita . . . ut ⁹) to think that they could either con·
sent or decline without a breach of obligation, whereas Ι have been
pressed by rnen,' etc.

d. salvo officio. Cf. ξ 95 ‘ salva fide.’

e. ignorare. Here ‘ to display ignorance of,' ‘ show myself in-
sensible to : ’ not as below in 5 5.

f. nec auctoritatem, etc. The end of the sentence does not
exactly tally with the beginning, as ‘auctoritatem’ corresponds
better to ‘ dignitate‚' and ‘ voluntatem ' to ‘ beneficiis.'

a. causis . causae. This use of the same word in close juxta· ξ 5,
position in different senses is mentioned by Cicero (Orator, ᾗ 135)
as one of the ornaments of style (‘ orationis lumina et quodammodo
insignia ‘). Terence (Haut. Prol. 41) plays on the same word——

‘ mea causa causam hanc iustam esse animum inducite,’
‘on my account believe this account,' etc. Cornificius, in the treatise
‘ ad Herennium‘ (IV, §5 20, 21), calls this figure ‘ traductio,' and gives
instances which are very pronounced pth, e. g. ‘nam amari iucundum
est, si curetur, ne quid insit amari.' Quintilian (IX. 3, § 69) men-
tions it with disapprobation‚ as ‘ etiam in iocis frigidum.' Cicero,
unless he is meaning to be jocose, does not allow the transition of
sense to be violent. Cp. Pro Quinctio, ξ 45 ad fin.-—‘ ergo id ut
confitear postulas, ut, quod nunquam factum esse iudicio conten·
dimus, id proinde quasi factum sit nostro iudicio confirmemus.’

b. patronus. This word is specially used of one who defends
another at law, as opposed to ‘ accusator.’

c. exstiti. The perfect (as distinct from the aon‘st) may be
followed either by the primary or by the historic tenses of the
subjunctive. Contrary to the practice of most writers, the latter is
the prevailing construction in Cicero. See P. S. L. G„ ξ 229, Ι. 1.

d. uti ne. Cp. ξ 54 ⁵ ut ne plane videaris.' ‘Ut ne' is more
decided and emphatic than ‘ ne ’ alone would be.

e. esset. Not here a mere auxiliary, else the tense would be
plupf. defensus and desertus are used adjectivally‚ doubtless
for the rhetorical effect of the antithesis. ’

f. qui iste, etc. ‘ Qui ’ is adjectival—‘ of what nature Ρ ’ ‘ Iste ’
refers to the words which Cicero has just used—‘ qui minimo peri-
culo possem dicere.’

g. pro capite et fortunis. For ‘ caput' see ξ 1 Iob, and sor the
use of the pl. in ‘ fortunis’ see ξ 7b. The combination of the two
words has become so much of a regular phrase, that it is used
here, where there is no question of the retention of Roscius’

property.
