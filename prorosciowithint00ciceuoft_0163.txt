 

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ἕξ 108-111.

in keeping with the explanation of Aulus Gellius: not so Cicero's
‘ detrahere manubias’ Verr. ii. 1, ξ 157, where Asconius (or the
writer who goes under his name) interprets it in a sense equivalent
to ‘spolia opima.'

j. re cognita, ‘after due inquiry’—a sarcastic application of a
law term.

a. in decem primis. See ξ 25 b.

b. ex ipsa legatione, ‘ merely from his conduct on this deputa·
tion.'

c. integrum, ‘ inviolate.' From ‘ in ’ and ‘tango ’ (stem ‘ tag-').

d. virum. ‚iudicatote. See ξ 18 g.

ξ 109.

&Impedirnento est quo minus. The verbal noun is here con· § 110

structed like the verb from which it comes. For the dative with
‘’est put absolutely, cp. ξ 48 c.

b. capitis periculum. We may render this ‘danger to life,’ but
the worst that a Roman citizen had to fear was civil death, the
extinction of his rights as a citizen (¹ caput ⁹), involving banishment
and confiscation of goods.

c. acuere, ‘eggs on.’ From this point onwards we slip into the
historic infinitive, which is especially used in a rapid sketch of pro-
ce‘edings like the following. It resembles a rough sketch of the
painter’s brush, raising an idea, without fixing it too definitely.

d. eum illo eontra. hos, etc. The poverty of the English language
in the matter of pronouns will be borne in upon the student in
attempting to translate this passage. In Latin there is no confusion.
We have ‘ sese’ for ‘ Capito,’ ‘ ille ’ for ‘ Chrysogonus,' ‘ hi ’ for the
fellow-deputies.

c. isto . . . intercessore, ‘through his roeommendafion, advice,
and intervention.' Cp. ξ 26.

f. fide . . . decepti. See § 116 e, ξ 29 a.

g. testimonium eis denuntiare, ‘ to sub-poena them.’ Except
under the ‘ lex ambitus ' the power of compelling witnesses to attend
was confined to the accuser. Plin. Ep. VI. 5, ξ 2 ; ep. Quint. V. 7, ξ 9.
Where there is more than one witness spoken of, Cicero sometimes
uses the pl. of ‘ testimonium, ’ Verr. ii. I, ξ 51——‘ non putasti me tuis
familiarissimis 1n hanc rem testimonia denuntiaturumff

a. si qui. The distinction between‘ quis ’substantival and‘ qui, ’ξω

adjectival does not hold when‘ si ’precedes. Cp. Caes. Bell. Gall.
Ι. 48—‘ si qui graviore vulnere accepto equo deciderat, circum-

sistebant!
Ι b. rem mandatam, ‘a trust.’ The same thing as ‘mandatum'

below.
