favour of this supposition. For the name of the deceased
Sextus Roscius was by some means placed in the proscription-
list, though the time for new entries had expired, and his
goods, which were worth upwards of Αςοροο, were put up to
public auction, and knocked down to Chrysogonus for the
sum of ,517 145. 2d.1 In this way Chrysogonus is seen to
have had an interest in the crime. As for the Roscii, one of
them, Capito, was ultimately put in possession in his own
right of three of the finest of the farms3 while the other,
MagnuS, was sent to Ameria, as agent of Chrysogonus, to
take possession of the property of the proscribed and
murdered man.

ξ 15. Depulation of tlte Ameriam to Sulla.

The son of Sextus Roscius, who himself went by the same
name, had scarcely had time to attend to his father's funeral,
before he was ejected from house and home, and turned into
the world a beggar. His hard fate excited so much sympathy
among his fellow-townsmen, that an indignation meeting
was held on the part of the local government. The decuri-
ones, or town—council, passed a resolution that their ten
leading members should go on a deputation to Sulla at
Volaterrae, in order to inform him of the true state of the
case with regard to Sextus Roscius, and entreat him to vin-
dicate the reputation of the father and the fortunes of the
son. It happened untowardly for the success of this ex-
pedition, that one of the ten leading members of the town-
council was Titus Roscius Capito, the kinsman of the
murdered Sextus Roscius. Both he and Magnus, if we may
trust the statement of Cicero, had already deserted all their
family connexions‚ and thrown in their fortunes with Chryso-
gonus ². If this were known, it is the more surprising that
the rest of the commissioners should have allowed themselves

half a fax‘thing.
