double meaning which the word ‘ sector’ admits of. Cp. 55 88,
103, 149, 151. '

a. dies noctisque. Not ‘day and night,’ but ‘for whole days ξ 81,
and nights.' Cp. Phil. X, 5 20—‘ eum vero dies et noctis omnia nos
undique fata circumstent!

b. concursabant, ‘ were rushing about? The ‘ con· ’ is intensive,
as in ‘contremo,’ ‘ conticesc0,’ etc. The word therefore does not
necessarily imply joint action. Cp. Pro Q. 5 53, where it is used of
a single person in the sense of ‘bustling off.' So Cat. IV, 5 17-
‘lenonem quemdam Lentuli concursare circum tabernas!

c. adsidui. See 5 67d.

d. huic crimini . . . fore. See 5 40 f,

e. tute. See 5 76 d. ·

a. Erueii criminatio, etc. ‘Erucius' whole line of accusation ᾖ 82.
has been met, I think? Cp. Pro Q. 5 33—‘ inaudita criminatione
accusatorum ’ ; Pro Q. Rosc. Com. 5 37—‘ criminatio tua quae est ’θ’

b. dissoluta est. ‘ Dissolvere ' appears to be a less precise word
than the ‘diluere' which follows. Thus, in speaking of ridicule,
Cicero says (De Orat. II, 5 2 36)—‘ odiosasque res saepe, quas argu-
mentis dilui non facile est, ioco risuque dissolvit.'

c. nisi forte. Quintilian says (IV. 13‚5 22)—‘ Nonnunquam tamen
quaedam bene et contemnuntur vel tanquam levia vel tanquam nihil
ad causam pertinentia. Multis hoc locis fecit Cicero.’

d. de peculatu. Some light is perhaps thrown on this by the
words in 5 144—‘ si nihil de patris fortunis amplissimis in suam rem
convertit.’ On the hypothesis that the goods of Sextus Roscius the
elder had been confiscated, the retention of any part of them by the
son might be characterized by the accuser as embezzlement of state
property.

e. declamare, ‘to be spouting.' Cp. Phil. ΙΙ, 5 42—‘ tot dies
aliena in villa declamasti ⁸? '

f. eommentaretur. Frequentative or intensive form of ‘ com-
miniscor,' and equivalent in sense to ⁴ meditari ' and the Greek
μελετᾶν.

g. verbo arguit. By mere assertion, without calling witnesses.

h. ad testis. The usual order of procedure was for the witnesses
to be called after the speeches on both sides had been delivered.
See Verr. i, 5 55; ii. I‚.§ 27.

a. fides, ‘duty.’ ξ 83·

b. creseere. Notice the phrase ‘ ex aliquo crescere,’ ‘to advance
one’s reputation at the expense of somebody.' ‘ De aliquo crescere '
is used in the same sense. ‚See Verr. ii. V,5 1733 and for ‘ crescere '
