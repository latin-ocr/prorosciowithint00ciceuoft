os law, Cicero afterwards pronounced it the worst and most illegal
law that was ever passed. De Leg. Agr. ΙΙΙ, 5 5—‘ omnium legum
iniquissimam dissimillimamque legis esse arbitror eam, quam L.
Flaccus interrex de Sulla tulit, ut omnia, quaecumque ille fecisset,
essent rata.' The practieal effect of this law was to put the lives of
all the citizens at the merey of the dictator. See De Leg. Ι, ς 42;
Verr. ii. 111, ξ 81.

b. non enim novi nec scio, ‘for I am not acquainted with it.
and so do not know which it is.' There is the same distinction
between ‘ nosse ’ and ‘ scire ’ as between ‘ connaitre ' and ‘ savoir ’ in
French. Cp. Ter. And. 934-—

‘ CH. Phania illic frater meus fuit. SI. noram et scio.’
‘ Ι was acquainted with him and am aware of the fact!

c. qui potuerunt. Notice the emphasis that is thrown upon
these words by their occurrence both at the beginning and at the
end of the sentence. When words are repeated by a Latin author
who is careful of his style, the order is generally varied. The
rhetorical writers call this ‘conduplicati0.' See Ad H. IV, 5 38—-
‘ Conduplicatio est cum ratione amplificationis aut commiserationis
eiusdem unius aut plurium verborum iterati0.’

a. seriptum . . . ita, ‘its terms are as follows.'

b. quo in numero, ‘ well, Sextus Roscius is not one of those.’
Cp. 5 79 b.

c. Si lege. Supply ‘ occisus est.'

a. quem vis. In full ‘ in quem vis (me haec dicere),’ the preposi-
tion being supplied from the preceding clause.

b. ab initio. Cp. ξ 21 ad fin.

c. ut ementiretur, ‘ that he lied ' =an infin. clause.

d. apud adversarios. Thus he was brought under the terms of
the law——‘ qui in adversariorum praesidiis occisi sunt.’ ·

e. passus non sit. The change of tense may have been meant
to mark a definite and particular act. Landgraf however suggests
that the reason is merely metrical‚ to avoid the termination of an
hexameter—‘ non pateretur)

f. id quod postea. This subject must have been dealt with in
the part of the speech which is lost (5 132).

a. esse in lege, ‘it is stated in the law.' Cp. the phrase ‘ esse in
fatis.’ Halm, omitting ‘ nimirum,’ takes ‘ Kalendas Iunias ‘ as the
subject of · esse.’

b. quam ad diem, ‘ by what date? ‘ Dies ’ in this sense is fem„
while in the ordinary sense of a day it is masc. in the best writers.
See this point clearly brought out by a passage in Caesar, De Bell.
