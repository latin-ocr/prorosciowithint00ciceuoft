ξ 5. He is appointed dictator.

But Sulla, like Augustus, had the art to veil to some
extent his despotism under forms recognised by the Roman
constitution. An interrex, L. Valerius Flaccus, was appointed,
who created Sulla dictator ¹, after that office had fallen into
disuse for 120 years; and the Romans now beheld the un-
precedented sight of four and twenty lictors within the city
walls 2. A measure was also passed known as the Lex
Valeria, which provided that all Sulla's enactments, past,
present, and to come, should have the force of law.

ς’ 6. His revenge upon his adversaries.

Then the vials of wrath were poured out over the doomed
city3 and a carnival of blood reigned unchecked from one
end of Italy to the other3 the very temples were polluted
with murder3 no ties of kindred or of blood were sacred
enough to excite compassion ; husbands were slaughtered in
their wives' embraces and sons in their mothers' arms.

Amid the consternation caused by this indiscriminate
carnage, one young nobleman, Caius Metellus, had the
hardihood to ask the dictator in the senate, to what length
he meant to go. ‘We do not pray for pardon,’ he said,
‘ for those whom you have resolved to slay3 all we ask is to
have rescued from anxiety those whom you intend to spare.'
Sulla replied that he did not yet know who were to be
acquitted. ‘ Then tell us‚' was the answer, ‘ whom you mean
to punish.’ This Sulla undertook to do. Then, without
consulting any of the magistrates, he published a list of 80
names, which was followed after a day's interval by another
