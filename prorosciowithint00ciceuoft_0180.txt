PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾗῇ 146-148.

The meaning is that Sulla's victory was so complete that there was
no chance of a reaction.

c. ne monumenti quidem causa, ‘ not even as a keepsake.’
Cp. Verg. Aen. V. 538—‘ monumentum et pignus amoris.'

d. pirata. Πειρατής is a later Greek substitute for the earlier
λῃστής.

e. cruenta spolia. Halm points out that in Greek this would be
αἱματόεντα τὰ σκεύη, not τὰ αἱματόεντα σκεύη.

a. contra rem tuam, ‘ against your interests! Cp. Phil. ΙΙ, ξ 3—
⁶ contra rem suam me nescio quando venisse questus est.’

b. Baliarici filia, Nepotis sorore. These words are out of
keeping with the explanatory comment in ξ 27, ‘Nepotis filiam.’
Possibly both are glosses: but the words before us harmonize very
well with their surroundings. In the De Divinatione (Ι, 54, ad fin.)
Cicero relates that in the consulship of L. Julius Caesar and P.
Rutilius Lupus (B. C. 90) the temple of Juno Sospita was restored by
decree of the senate in consequence of a dream of Caecilia, the
daughter of Baliaricus. Ι

c. quae cum, etc., ‘who, though she had a most illustrious father,
most exalted uncles‚ a most accomplished brother, nevertheless,
woman though she was, managed by a man’s courage to bring no
less distinction on them from her merits than the honour with which
she was herself invested in consequence of their worth.' The con-
struction is based upon the simple sentence ‘ ut tantum illis honorem
redderet, quantum ipsa ab iis acciperet.’

d. clarissimum patrem. Q. Caecilius Metellus, consul 13.c. 123,
who derived his ‘ agnomen’ from the conquest of the Baliares. He
was the eldest of four brothers, each of whom attained in his turn to
the consulship. Their father, Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, is
cited by Velleius Paterculus (Ι. 12) as an extraordinary instance of
human- felicity.

e. amplissimos patruos. Three of them, namely, L. Metellus

· Diadematus, M. Metellus, and C. Metellus Caprarius‚ who attained

§148.

to the consulship in B.c. 117, 115 and 113 respectively.

f. ornatissimum fratrem. Q. Caecilius Metellus Nepos, consul
in B.c. 98. The name ‘Nepos’ perhaps indicates that he was the
eldest grandson of the celebrated Macedonicus. .

a. An quod, ‘ or is it that etc. ’ἓ ’ ‘An ' always points to a previous
alternative, expressed or understood. Here it carries us back to
‘ nisi hoc indignum putas.'

b. pro, ‘ in proportion to.’ We may render it here ‘ in view of.'

c. hospitiis. See ξ, 15 h.
