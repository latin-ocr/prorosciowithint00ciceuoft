ξ, 53.

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTEs. ἕξ 51—53. ⁶

De Inv. I, ξ 4—‘cum ad gubernacula reipublicae temerarii atque
audaces homines accesserant?

e. cum ruri adsiduus, etc. To be taken closely with esse
rusticum, ‘in that he has always stuck close to the country.' The
clause with ‘ cum . . . esset’ is on a different footing, and assigns
a reason for ‘ ignosci oportere.’

f. cum praesertim. See ξ 22 d.

, α. istum. Now that we have passed for the moment to the

opponent's point of view, the defendant becomes ‘ iste.’

b. exheredare. Long points out that according to Roman law it
w'as not enough for a father merely to pass over his son's name in
silence ; he had expressly to disinherit him, else the will was invalid.
For the infin. aster ‘in animo habebat’ cp. ξ 91 ‘in animo est . . .
transire.’

c. Audio. A formula of sarcastic acceptance. We would rather
say ‘I see'; and Cicero himself uses ‘video ' in the same sense
in Verr. ii. v, ξ 69. Cp. Ter. Phorm. 160.

d. illa, ‘the following reasons? Referring to the sentences ‘ con-
vivia cum patre non inibat ’ and ‘ domum suam,' etc. The pronoun
‘ ille,’ being of the 3rd person, denotes a circumstance remote from
the speaker. When understood of time, this remoteness may be
either in the future or in the past; and so ‘ille ' refers sometimes to
what is about to be mentioned, and sometimes to what has been
mentioned previously. For the anticipatory use of ‘ille ’ cp. ἓξ 4,
47, 75³ 86, 103·

e. Quippe. ‘Naturally.’ Cp. Pro Mil. 5 47.

f. ne in oppidum quidem. Not even to Ameria, much less to
Rome. Cp. ς 74 ad fin. ‘ Oppidum ’ was commonly used of
countiy towns, while ‘urbs ’ was reserved for the capital.

g. non fere quisquam. More emphatic than ‘ nemo fere.’

lz. qui . . . viveret. When the relative gives a reason, it is
constructed with the subjunctive.

τ’. revocaturus, ‘likely to ask him back.' ‘ Revocare ' is used in
the same way in Phaedrus' rendering of the fable of the fox and the
stork (i. 26. ¹7)—‘ Quae vulpem quum revocasset,' and in Martial,
Epig. III. 27—

‘Nunquam me revocas, venias quum saepe rogatus.’

j. haee . . . illud. Notice how the circumstances have changed
place. What was before ‘ illa ' has now become ‘ haec‚' having just
been mentioned, and what was introduced by ‘ nunc,' the temporal
equivalent to the pronoun ⁶ hic,’ is now referred to as ‘ illud!

a. Mitto quaerere. Equivalent to ‘non quaero‚’ as the impera-
