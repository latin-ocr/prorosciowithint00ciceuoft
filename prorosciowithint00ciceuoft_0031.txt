II. RHETORJCAL. 27

'goras added a fourth, and Cicero in his youth ¹ thought that he
was clearly right in doing so. For the dispute might be not
merely as to whether a thing was (controversia facti), or as to
the name by which it ought to be called (controversia
nominis), or as to the view which should be taken of its
nature (controversia generis), but also as to the right method
of trying a case (controversia actionis). To these four
possibilities of dispute (controversiarum genera) there were
four corresponding issues.

The question of fact gave rise to the constitutio con-
iecturalis.

The question of name gave rise to the constitutio de·
finitiva.

The question of kind gave rise to the constitutio generalis.

The question of procedure gave rise to the constitutio
translativa ². ⁰

The constitutio generalis is minutely subdivided. But
we will not follow it into its ramifications, especially as
Quintilian ³ points out that Cicero had erred on an important

point. N either will we go into the distinction between
questions of reasoning (in ratione) and questions of interpre-
tation (in script0)4: for there again Cicero’s classification
involves him in confusion, as he saw himself in after life ⁵.

¹ In the Orator (ξ 45) which was written in his sixty·first year,
Cicero only recognises three issues—sitne, quid sit, quale sit, cor-
responding to constitutio coniecturalis, definitiva, and generalis.

² Cornificius and Cicero part company altogether on this point.
Cornificius says that his teacher only recognised three issues, and
gives us to understand that it was not out of envy that he refused to
adopt the fourth (Ad H. i. ξ 18). Cicero says that it was out of
envy that the discovery of Hermagoras was not generally adopted.
Cicero's subdivisions of in scripto appear as the constitutio legitima
of Cornificius.

³ iii· 6, ἐξ 57-59·

⁴ Corresponding to the λογικόν and νομικόν of Hermagoras,
Quint. iii. 5, ξ 4.

⁵ A tacit correction of his youthful error is made in Orat. § 121.
