principium ¹. The various modes of conciliating goodwill
were tabulated for the speaker in his ‘ art ’ under the title of
benevolentiae loci. -

ξ 50. T he Narratio.

The object of the narratio is to set forth the facts in such

a way as to make them tell in favour of one’s own case and
against that of the adversary. Its merits are to be brief,
clear, and probable. Under the head of narratio in a wider
sense comes the story told by way of illustration or to make
some point against the oppon'ents, of which we have instances

in the Pro Roscio, in the anecdotes of Fimbria (§ 33), and of
the sons of Coelius (ξ 64).

§ 51. The Partz'tz'o.

The partitio should itself consist of two parts—

(1) a statement of the points agreed upon between the
parties and of the points in dispute, which
amounts to setting forth the iudicatio ;

(2) a brief declaration, under definite heads, of the line
of argument which it is intended to pursue.

The first section of the partitio is reduced to a vanishing
point in the Pro Rosci0, since Cicero's position is that the
adversaries had not a vestige of fact to go upon ².

The second section indicates to us the three heads of—

(1) the defence against Erucius ς

(2) the countercharge against the Roscii ;

(3) the attack on Chrysogonus.

In his Brutus (ξ 302) Cicero records that Hortensius was the
first Roman orator who used partitio; and in the Pro
Quinctio (ξ 35) we find him paying his rival the compliment
of saying that he will imitate him in adopting it.
