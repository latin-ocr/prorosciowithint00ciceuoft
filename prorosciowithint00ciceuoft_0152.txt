PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξς 88, 89.

b. egentissimus, Superlative formed from the participle ‘ egens.’
‘ Egens' in the sense of ‘ needy ⁹ is of much more frequent occurrence
than ‘ egenus! On the comparison of participles cp. §47 f

c. feratur infestus in, ‘ rushes to attaek!

d. quaestum . . . . fructum. ‘ Quaestus’ is ‘ profit,' ‘ fructus:
‘ produce.' The contrast between them marks the antipathy of an
agricultural people to trade and commerce. Cp. Tusc. Disp. V, 5 86
-‘ quaestuosa mercatura, fructuosa aratio dicitur ' ; Liv. XXI. 63, ξ 4
—‘id satis habiturn ad fructus ex agris vectand0s; quaestus omnis
patribus indecorus visus.’

e. sectorum audacissimus, ‘ the most reckless of brokers,' The
words are at the same time intended to call up the idea of the

same sense in De InV. 1, ξ 34. ’

d. non enim tantum, etc.‚ ‘ for, without being arrogant, Ι (10 not
so much disparage myself‚' etc. Notice the contrast between
‘ derogo ’ and ‘ adrogo.’ The former is to ask to have something
taken away, the latter is to ask to have something added.

e. in grege, ‘one of the common herd.' The opposite notion is
conveyed by the adj. ‘ egregius.' patronorum belongs more
immediately to multitudinem than to in grege.

f. pugna Cannensis. Under this expression Cicero refers to the
horrors of the proscription. In the same way he speaks of Verres’⁴
banquets as ‘Cannensem pugnam nequitiae' (Verr. V, ξ 28), with
reference to the prostrate bodies of the guests who had succumbed
to the bottle. ’

g. lacum. ‘ Lacus ’ means ‘ a tank,’ like the Greek λάκκος, as well
as ‘ a lake.’

lz. Servilium. This reservoir in Rome was named after the man
who constructed it. It was situated at the entrance to the Vicus
Jugarius, hard by the Basilica Julia (Miiller's Festus, p. 290).
During the proscription it had been decorated with the heads of
victims. See Seneca de Prov. 3—‘ Videant largum in foro sanguinem
et supra Servilium laeum (id enim proscriptionis Sullanae spoliarium
est) senatorum capita, et passim vagantes per urbem percussorum
