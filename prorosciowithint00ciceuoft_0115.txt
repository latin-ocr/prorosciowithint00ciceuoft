the last refuge of the proscribed Marian party. Its inhabitants
held out against Sulla for two years, until at last they obtained
terms of surrender. The description of the place as given by
Strabo (V. 2, p. 360 Tauchn.) is enough to account for this long
resistauce. He says that the town was built on a flat-topped hill,
which rose out osa deep ravine, and had a precipitous deseent on
every side.

cl. fundos. The exact meaning of ‘fundus‚’ as defined in later
legal Latin, is a piece of land in the country with a house on it, as
opposed to ‘ ager‚' which implies no building. Digest L. 16, ξ 211
——‘ ager cum aedificio “ fundus '’ dicitur.’

e. decem et tris. Notice the form of the numeral. The order
is reversed in ξ 99, where we have ⁶ tribus et decem.' Caesar (Bell.
Gall. Ι. 8) has ⁴ decem novem’ sor nineteen.

fi Tiberim ..... tangunt. Increasing the value by supplying
the element of convenience of situation. The crops would be con-
veyed by river to Rome, at least in the winter and spring. Pliny,
Epist. V. 6, ς’ 12—‘ Medios ille (i. e. Tiberis) agros secat, navium
patiens, omnesque fruges devehit in urbem, hieme dumtaxat et
vere.¹

ξ. tam splendidus. ‘ Tam ’ is used as in our colloquial phrases,
‘ so pretty,' &c. ‘ Splendidus ' may be considered a standing epithet
of the equestrian order, in the same way as ‘ amplus' of the sena-
torial. Cp.§ 140-——‘ equestrem splendorem3’ Pro Plancio, § 12—-
· ne equestrem quidem splendorem;' Pro Mil. § 74——‘ equite Romano,
splendido et forti viro ; ’ De Nat. Deor. III, ξ 74—‘ Q. Sosius, splen-
didus eques Romanus.’ In the time of Augustus the ‘ census eques-
ter ' was fixed at 100‚000 sesterces.

lz. Ne diutius teneam, ‘ not to be tedious.’ For the omission of
‘vos’ cp. Verr. ii. Ι, ξ 34—‘ ne diutius teneam, pecunia attributa,
numerata est.’

ι’. societas coitur. This is a term borrowed from business. ‘ A
joint-stock company is formed? But it contains also a hint of con-

spiracy. Cp. 5 87 ad in.

a. refertur in tabulas, ‘set down on the proscription list! This ξ 21.

entailed as a consequence the confiscation of all his goods.

b. manceps. The legal term for the purchaser of anything at a
public auction‚ or sor one who takes a contract from the state.
Festus (Miiller, p. 151)—‘ Manceps dicitur, qui quid a populo emit

Div. 5 33 ad in.

c. vel nobilissima. See* § 6 e.
