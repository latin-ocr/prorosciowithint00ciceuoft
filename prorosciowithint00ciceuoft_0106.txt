PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. §8.

‘cumulus‘ cp. Ad Att. IV. 19 ad fin.—‘ ad summam laetitiam
meam, quam ex tuo reditu capio, magnus illius adventu cumulus
accedet)

l. vel hoc indignissimum. Disarrangement of order for
emphasis. The ⁴ vel ’ really belongs to ‘ indignissimum.’ Cp. §6 e.

m. iusque iurandum. For references to the oath taken by the
judges see ἐξ 101, 140, 152 and Verr. i, ξ 40—‘iuratorum hominum
sententiae‚’ on which Asconius’ comment is-‘ iudicum scilicet, qui
in leges antequam iudicarent iurare consueverant.’ See also De Inv.
Ι, ξ 70, ΙΙ, ξ 131 ; but there Cicero is no doubt following his Greek
original. '

n. ex civitate in senatum. Sulla had recently filled up the
senate by the addition of 300 persons of equestrian rank elected by
the assembly of the tribes (Appian De Bell. Civ. I. 100); the rest of
the members entered the senate after having held high office iu the
state3 so that in either case there was a proof of merit (‘ propter.
dignitatem ⁵).

0. ex senatu in hoe eonsilium. Only senators could act as
judges according to the law which had just been enacted by Sulla.
The office had been transferred from thern to the knights by C.
Gracchus in B.C. 122. Ten years after the date of this speech
(Rc. 70) it was divided by Cotta between the two orders with the
addition of the ‘tribuni aerarii.' Thus we may distinguish four
periods with regard to the constitution of the judicial body——

(Ι) down to Β. C. 122—Senators only.

(2) 122-81, under the Lex Sempronia—Equites only.

(3) 81—7o‚ under the Lex Cornelia—senators.

(4) aster 70 under the Lex Aurelia—Senators, EquiteS, Tribuni

Aerarii.

p. ab his, ‘ from such as you.’ Strict grammar would require the
2nd pers. here.

q. postulare. A repetition under another form of the infinitive
‘ vos idoneos habitos,’ and, like it, depending on ‘ indignissimum est.’

r. homines sicarie& Cp. ξ 120 ‘homines paene operarios.’
This superfluous employment of ‘ homo ' is frequent in comedy‚ e. g.
Ter. Phorm. 292—

‘Servom hominem causam orare leges non sinunt.’
So ‘ho'mines adulescentulos ’ Andr. 910, etc.

s. sicarios. This word properly means one who stabs with a
dagger, but it came to be used for any assassin. Quint. X. 1, 5 12—
‘ Nam per abusionem sicarios etiam omnes vocamus, qui eaedem
telo quocunque commiserint?
