NOTES.

—04—

a. quid sit quod. Cp. the opening of the Pro Sestio—‘ Si quis ξ 1.
antea, iudices, mirabatur quid esset, quod,' etc. ‘ Quid sit quod ' is
a more formal way of saying ‘ cur.' It occurs again in ξ 99—‘ Quid
erat quod Capitonem‚' etc. ‘ Quamobrem ' is sometimes used instead
of ‘ quod,’ e. g. Verr. Act. i, ξ 38—‘Cognoscet ex me populus Romanus
quid sit quamobrem, quum equester ordo iudicaret‚’ etc„ immediately
after which the constr. ‘ quid sit quod‘ is continued through several
clauseS.

b. auctoritate. A peculiarly Roman word, to which we have no
real equivalent. ‘Influenee' may do here. ‘Auctoritas' was the
crown os age (‘ apex est autem senectutis auctoritas’ De Sen. ξ 60),
and Cicero was still a youth who had not, in the technical sense,
entered upon public life. Cp. ξ 3 ‘ nondum ad rempublicam
accessi.’

c. sim. Notice that all the verbs after ‘mirari' are in the sub·
jumtive, as being dependent clauses in the oblique narration.

d. novo, ‘ unprecedented.’

c. conflatam. Cp. ‘ conflavit' in § 5.

f defendi, ‘repelled’ The word is here used in its primary
sense. N otice the ehiasmus from putant to audent.

g. idcirco quia. Variety is given to the sentence by the substitu-
tion of ‘ ideirco quia’ for the equivalent ‘ propterea quod ' : there is
no difference of meaning. Cp. ‘ quo modo . . . qua ratione ’ in §42-

a. officiosior. ‘ Am I so much more sensitive to the claims of ᾗ 2.
others than the rest 3' ‘ Officium ' is a wider term than ‘ duty,' and
includes friendship and benevolence. Cp. ἐξ 1, 4, 27.

b. ne istius quidem, etc. ‘ May my desire even for that merit
not take the form of wishing to have it snatched from others ! '
⁴ Istius,’which is proper to the 2nd person, is used in answer to asup-
posed interlocutor. ‘ Laus ’ in Latin hovers between the two mean-
ings of ‘ praise ’ itself and the thing which deserves praise. In
