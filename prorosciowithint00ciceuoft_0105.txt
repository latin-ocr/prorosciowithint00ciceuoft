PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξς 7, 8.

aliquos illustris homines aut ad deos immortalis aut ad summam
reipublicae pertinere.'

a. causa criminis, ‘ reason for the charge.' ᾗ 8,

b. quam ob rem videantur . . . secuti, ‘ to make them seem to
have had after all some object in view in preferring the charge.’ For
this use of tamen cp. ᾗ 104 ‘paulo tamen occultior ; ’ Verr.
Div. ξ 48 ‘ut tu tamen aliquid esse videare;' Verg. Aen. IV.
329 ‘qui te tamen ore referret.’ For ‘res . . . quam ob rem,’ see
ξ 28 e.

c. illi . . . illorum. ‘ Ille‘ is used of the opponent, when the
orator is speaking of him rather than at him. Here the words are
addressed direct to the judges, as shown by the use of the and pers.
pl. ‘ inveneritis.'

d. in deferendo nomine. The form of process in a criminal
trial was as follows. The first step was the ‘ postulatio ’ or applica-
tion for leave to prefer the accusation; at some interval after this
(Caelius in Cicero, Ep. Fam. VIII. 6, ξ 1) followed the ‘nominis
delatio’ and after that the ‘nominis receptio ;’ then came the
‘ quaestio,’ or trial itself‚ generally about ten days after the
‘ receptio.’ Cp. ξ 28 b.

e. secuti. For the use of ‘sequi' in the sense of ‘ to keep in
vieW,' cp. ᾗ 34 g.

f. quiequam. The sentence is virtually negative, implying that
no such cause can be discovered. Hence the use of ‘quicquam.'
Cp. Vergil's—

‘Et quisquam Iunonis numen adorat
praeterea? ’ Aen. I. 48.

g. recusamus quin, ‘ demur to.‘

lz. sin aliud, etc.‚ ‘ but if the only point at issue is the satisfaction
of men who can never be satisfied.’ On ut ne see 5 5 d.

z'. hoc . . . pugnatur. Cp. ξ Ι2ο--ζ quod a vobis hoc pugnari
vide0.' This is the passive voice of the active constr. ‘pugnare
aliquid.' Phil. X, ᾗ 22 ‘ qui id pugnant, id agunt?

j. opimam praeclaramque praedam. Cicero’s wealth of dic-
tion appears in the phrases which he applies to 'this property. First
it was called ‘pecuniam tam amplam atque praeclaram‚' then ‘ patri-
monium tam amplum et copiosum‚' and now we have ‘opimam
praeclaramque praedam)

k. velut cumulus, ‘ as though to crown them all.' Cp. French
‘ comble.’ ‘ Cumulus ’ is what is added in corn after the measure is
already full. The word ‘auctarium ¹ has the same meaning, only
more general (Festus, Miiller‚ p. 14). For a similar use of
