 

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. §Q 16, ¹7·

h. fuisset. Had we ‘ fuit ’ here, it would be the usual ‘ both . . .
and’ or ‘not only . . . . but also.' The subjunctive represents the
former fidelity of Roscius to the nobles as a reason why he should
specially exert himself on their behalf at a time when their dignity
and their very existence were brought into jeopardy. Cp. Verr Ι,
ξ 11--‘ eum, cui et legatus et pro quaestore fuisset?

c hoc tumultu proximo, ‘the late disturbancesss i. e. the civil
war. The word‘ tumultus’ was specially used of a rising in Italy
or Gaul (Phil. VIII, ξ 3; Cat. ΙΙΙ, ξ 4; Liv. XXI. 28, ξ 4), and is
absurdly derived by Cicero from ‘timor multus,' in which he is fol-
lowed by Servius (on Verg. Aen. VIII. 1).

d. opera, studio, auctoritate, ‘ exertions‚ zeal, and influence.'

e. propter quoe. See ξ 63 c.

f numerabatur. This is put as a fact, not merely as the idea of
Roscius. Hence the indicative.

g. ab armisque recessimus. (Ἐρμῇ 126 ‘ab armis recessum
est?

Ιι. frequens. Many Latin adjectives have to be rendered by an
adverb in English. For a striking instance take Hor. Carm. III.
20. 8-

‘grande certamen, tibi praeda cedat
major an illi.’

i. ut exsultare, etc. The ‘ ut’ of consequence, not of pur-
pose.

a. veteres inimicitiae, a long· -standing feud,’ arising, it would §172
seem, out of a family quarrel about property. See ξ 87 ad fin.
The plural is usual 1n this word. Cp. ἐξ 55, 1453 De Inv. ΙΙ,
§zo—⁶ si amicitiae, si inimicitiarum (causa).' The idea may be
that of a continued course of hostility. Julius Caesar in his gram-
matical treatise ‘De Analogia' laid down that ‘inimicitiae’ could
only be used in the plural, like ‘arma‚’ ‘moenia,’ and ‘ comitia ’
(Aul. Gell. XIX. 8). Landgraf however points to the sing. in a
philosophical sense in Tusc. IV, 5 16, and Aulus Gellius quotes it
from Ennius.

b. alterum ..... alterum. The first ‘ alterum ' refers to Titus
Roscius Magnus, upon whose presence on the accusers’ benches
Cicero is repeatedly harping (ἐξ 84, 87, 95, 104), the second to
Titus Roscius Capito. For the fact of the latter being in possession
of the farms (‘praedia ’ or ‘ fundi ') see ἐξ 21, 99.

c. viveret, ‘ he would now be alive?

cl. iniuria, ‘without good reason! Cp. 5 116.

e. plurimarum palmarum, ‘who has won many a laureL'
