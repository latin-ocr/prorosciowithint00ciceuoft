sought to make political capital at the cost of an opponent
who had been more consistent than himself in his adherence
to a fallen cause. Already he had given proof of those powers
of persiflage, of that mira urbanitas, which so greatly delighted
Quintilian¹‚ and which formed so marked a feature in his
character through life. With such a training and with such
native powers Cicero was more than a match for Erucius,
despite the long experience of the latter· in the tricks of law.

nothing beyond what can be gathered from a perusal of the

country. Further it was alleged that his father had meant to
disinherit him.

Against the charge of rusticity Cicero is at no pains to
defend his client ; but turns it to his own account by praising

were in theory so much enamoured. It is likely enough

that the man was one of those incorrigible clod-hoppers, ·

‘whose talk is of oxen,' like the character described by
Theophrastus, who took no interest in anything‚ unless he
saw an ox or an ass or a he—goat on the road, and then he
