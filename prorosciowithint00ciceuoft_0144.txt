failure of nature, there would have been no room sor the terrors
of the law,

k. summoverentur‚ ‘warned off! The metaphor is from the
lictor telling the people to ‘ move on.'

l. insui . . . in culeum. The punishment of parricides is thus
described by Modestinus (Digest, XLVIII. 9, ξ 9)—-‘ Poena parri-
cidii more maiorum haec instituta est, ut parricida virgis sanguineis
verberatus deinde culleo insuatur cum cane, gallo gallinaceo et
vipera et simia3 deinde in mare profundum culleus iactatur ²-—
that is to say, the parricide was to be beaten with blood-red rods,
and then sewn up in a sack along with a dog, a cock, a viper, and a
monkey‚ after which he was flung into the depths of the sea. Cp.

Juv. VIII. 212—14—
‘ Neroni,

cuius supplicio non debuit una parari

simia nec serpens unus nec culleus unus3’
and Seneca, De Clem. I. 15—‘ non culleum, non serpentes, non car·
cerem decrevit.'

Further details as to the punishment of the sack may be gathered
from the De Inventione (ΙΙ, ξ 149; cp. Ad H. 1, 5 23). Imme-
diately on conviction the criminal’s head was tied up in a bag made
of wolf-skin, and wooden shoes were put on his feet, in which guise
he was carried off to prison, to be kept there until the sack was
ready, in which he was to be thrown into running water. From the
silence of Cicero it may perhaps be inferred that he knew nothing
about the animals which were made to share the parricide's doom.
It would appear that this part of the penalty was first enacted by
the Lex Pompeia de parricidiis (Just. Inst. IV. 18, 5 6).

‚ a. ex rerum natura. Consisting, as it was supposed, of the -

four elements, earth, air, fire, and water, which are mentioned im-
mediately afterwards. So in the Institutes of Justinian (IV. 18, ξ 6)
it is said—⁶ ut omni elementorum usu vivus carere incipiat et ei cae-
lum superstiti, terra mortuo auferatur?

b. unde. Osten thus used of persons. Cp. Hor. Carm. 1. xxviii.

‘ multaque merces
unde potest tibi defluat aequo
ab Jove.'

c. feris corpus obicere. In the time of Hadrian it was enacted
that the parricide was to be thrown to the beastS, if the sea were
distant, Dig. XLVIII. 8, ξ 9.

d. tantum scelus, ‘ so guilty a thing.' Abstract sor concrete.
