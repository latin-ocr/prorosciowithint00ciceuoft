PRO SEX. ROSCIO, NOTES. ᾧῷ 68-70.

pitate.' Perhaps we have the same sense in Tac. Ann. XVI. 7-—
‘iuvenem animo praeruptum.’

c. acerbum, ‘ unnatural.’ The idea underlying the word is that
of an unripe fuit. Nature, in the ancient sense, is the perfectiori of
a thing's being. Not the sour crab, but the wonder of the Hespe-
rides, is the natural apple.

a. in impios, ‘for the undutiful.' Cp. 5 66 f ξ 69-

α. ea.. In contrast with other states and nations that held empire. ξ 70,
Cp. ξ, 41 c.

b. rerum potita est. Here ‘ potior’ means ‘to be in possession
οῖ] Cp. Tac. Ann. ΙΙ. 42—‘ Rex Archelaus quinquagesimum annum
Cappadocia potiebatur.'

c. hodie quoque. Athens, as a free city, was allowed to retain
its own institutions under the Roman empire.

d. scripsit. The use of the indie. shows that the words frorn
‘ eum, qui ' onwards are an explanatory comment of Cicero’s
own.

e. is cum interrogaretur. The same story is told by Diogenes
Laertius (Solon, ξ 59).

f. Sapienter. Herodotus (Ι. 137) praises the wisdom of the
Persians in not admitting the possibility of parricide. They main-
tained that in 311 supposed cases it would be found on investigation
·that the child was either supposititious or born in adultery. Seneca
complained that the crime of parricide had increased after the im-
position (or revival) of the penalty. He tells Nero (De Clem. I. 2 3)
that his father (i. e. Claudius who adopted him) had used the penalty
of the sack more often within five years than had been recorded in
all previous ages, and goes on to say—⁶ Summa enim prudentia

' altissimi viri et rerum naturae peritissimi maluerunt, velut incredibile
scelus, et ultra audaciam positum praeterire, quam, dum vindicant,
ostendere posse fieri!

g. admonere, ‘to suggest.' Pro Tull. ξ 9——‘ non tam prohibere
videretur quam admonere; ' De Dom. ξ 127—‘n0n tam deterrere
videretur quam admonere.'

h. sapientius. Supply ‘fecerunt ' from ‘ fecisse ' above.

τ’. aliquando. According to Plutarch (Romul. 22) six hundred
-years elapsed after the founding of the city before any case of parri-
cide occurred. The first perpetrator of the crime was L. Hostius
shortly after the Second Punic War. The first case on record of the
punishment of the sack being employed is that of Publicius Mal—
leolus, about B.c. 101, who killed his mother (Liv. Epit. 68).

j. potuisset. Notice the tense. Were it not for a previous
