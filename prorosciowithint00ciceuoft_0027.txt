II. RHETORICAL. 23

in the practice of speaking, while claiming to be perfect in
theory. He expresses a contempt for the subtleties of logie,
but has wide-reaching literary ambitions, andv proposes to
write on grammar, on mental science‚ possibly also on the
art of war and politics ¹.

ξ 38. Its authorsth.

It can be proved from Quintilian that the name of this
author was Cornificius 2. The work itself contains an ob-
scure, but recognisable, reference to the second consulship
of Sullai’. It was therefore composed after the De In-
ventione, and if there was imitation, it was on the part of
Cornificius, not of Cicero. But the facts are sufficiently
accounted for by the supposition that the author attended
the same course of lectures as Cicero, and that both pupils
subsequently gave to the world the contents of their note-
books ⁴². If this view be correct, the author of Ad Heren-
nium may very well be the Q. Cornificius who stood against
Cicero for the consulship ⁵, who is referred to in the trial of
Verres as a most upright judge ⁶, to whose charge Cicero
committed the conspirator Cethegus ⁷, and who was the first
to lay before the senate the violation of the mysteries of the
Bona Dea ⁸.

⁴ The difficulty in aceepting this view is that the author claims
credit for originality in his treatment of ‘insinuatio ² (Ad H. i. ἐξ 9,
16), whereas the same treatment appears in the De Inventione
(i. ᾗ 23) without remark. But we do not know when the De
Inventione was given to the world, and in claiming originality
the writer may mean no more than that the point had not been
embodied in any published treatise before. He is confessedly
following a master, whom he calls ‘ noster doctor ' in i. ς 18.
