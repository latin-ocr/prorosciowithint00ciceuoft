b. nisi hoe video. ‘ Nisi ' here means ‘ only‚’ ‘ except that!

c. tribus et decem. See ξ 20 e..

a. Audio praeterea. Here Cicero proceeds to act on the maxim
he had previously laid down in the -De Inventione (II, 5 32)-‘vitam
eius, quem arguit, ex ante factis accusator improbare debebit et
ostendere, si quo in pari ante peccato convictus sit.’

b. lemniscatam, ‘ of special note.’ A ‘ corona lemniscata‘ was
one adorned with coloured ribbons called ‘ lemnisci ’ (Festus, p. 113.
Cp. Liv. XXXIII. 33—‘ turba . . . coronas lemniscosque iacientium ').
Servius uses the term to explain Vergil’s line (Aen. V. 268>-

‘ puniceis ibant evincti tempora taenis,
and quotes Varro as saying that such a crown was a mark of special
honour. Cp. Ausonius, Epist. XX. 5, 6-
‘ et quae iamdudum tibi palma poetica pollet,
lemnisco ornata est, quo mea palma caret.’

When Sulla was sacrificing at Tarentum after his return to Italy,
the entrails of the victim are related to have assumed the form of
a crown of bay with two λημνίσκοι attached to it. Plut. Suu. 27.

c. quae . . . deferatur, ‘to be conferred.’

d. habeo etiam dicere, etc. ‘ I can also mention one whom,
contrary to the custom of our ancestors, as he was under sixty years
of age, he threw down from the bridge into the Tiber.’ Notice the
use of ‘habeo ' in the sense of ‘ can ' with ‘ dicere ’ = ἔχω λέγειν.

e. morem maiorum. On the 14th of May it was the custom at
Rome for the priests and the Vestal Virgins to proceed to the Pons
Sublicius, and solemnly to throw wicker work images of men into
the Tiber, See Ovid, Fast. V. 621-662. These images were called
‘Argei' <Fast.111. 7913 Varro‚L. L. VII, ξ 44—‘Argei fiunt e scirpeis,
simulacra hominum XXIV ; ea quotannis de ponte sublicio a sacerdo-
tibus publice deici solent in Tiberim'). The origin of this carious
custom was lost in antiquity. Ovid has to invoke the river Tiber,
as being more ancient than Rome itself‚ to supply a fanciful expla-
nation of it. The popular idea in his day connected the rite with-
aboriginal human sacrifices, which were supposed to have been '
stopped by Hercules, and men of straw substituted for the real
victims (Cp. Festus, p. 334, Lact. Div. Inst. Ι. 21). Hence the name
‘ Argei’ (=’Ap7e?oc, Varro L. L. V, ξ 45). Another explanation is
referred to by Ovid (F ast. V. 633, 4) in these words—

‘Pars putat, ut ferrent iuvenes suffragia soli,
pontibus infirmos praecipitasse senes ;'
where ‘pontes ’ is usually explained of the gangways leading to the
‘septa' or polling—booths (Cp. Ad H. I, fi 21—‘ pontes disturbat, cistas
