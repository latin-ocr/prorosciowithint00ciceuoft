turnis,' if we suppose the murder to have been committed in the
summer (cp. 5 128), when the hours of the night would be shorter
than those of the day. Five-sixths (ἓξὲξ) of a summer night is
considerably less than what ten hours would mean with us. Simi-
larly, when daylight hours are spoken of, ‘ hiberna hora ' denotes a
shorter period than ‘ aestiva.’ Plaut. Pseud. V. ii. 11—

Si. ‘ Credo equidem potesse te, scelus, Massici montis uberrimos

quatuor

Fructus ebibere in hora una. Ps. “ hiberna,” addito. Sz‘. Haud

male mones.’

g. sex et quinquaginta. The Roman mile is estimated at 16¹8
English yards, so that 56 Roman. miles is almost exactly equal to
51} English. Glaucia's drive therefore was not so far as from Ox—
ford to London.

lz. cisiis pervolavit, ‘he posted.' The ‘cisium' was a light
two-wheeled vehicle used for rapid. travelling. Cp. Phil. II, 5 77.
The change of beasts at the various halting-places is probably
enough to account for the pl. The Scholiast informs us that the
‘ cisium ’ was a Gallie vehicle, from which Landgraf infers that the
word is of Celtic origin, like so many others connected with riding
and driving—‘ esseda, covinum, petorritum‚ raeda, benna' (which
appears to have been a basket-carriage)‚ ‘ caballus‚’ and probably
‘ carrus' and ‘ carruca? Cp. Caesar's remark on the fondness of the
Gauls for horses (De Bell. Gall. IV. 2).

i. nuntium. Notice how ‘nuntius’ denotes the message as well
as the messenger.

j. cruorem. ‘Sanguis' is blood in the veins; ‘cru0r‚’ blood
that has been shed, ‘ gore.’

, a. Quadriduo, quo, etc„ ‘within four days from the time when

these things were done.’ Cp. ξ 105, ‘quadridu0, quo is occisus est.’
Literally ‘within the space of four days in which.' The idiom is a
common one. Cp. Verr. ii. Ι, ξ 20—‘ una hora, qua coepi dicere;'
Caes. Bell. Gall. IV. 18—‘Diebus decern, quibus materia coepta
erat comportari ; ’ and with ⁴ in ’ preceding Ter. And. 104—-

‘ferme in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt,

Chrysis vicina haec moritur.’

b. ad Chrysogonum, etc. Notice here a difference between
Latin and English idiom. The Latin expresses motion with each
word; we should express it once for all. ‘ The matter is reported
to Chrysogonus in (Lat. into) the camp of L. Sulla at (Lat. to)
Volaterrae.' Cp. ξ 74 c.

c. Volaterras. A town in the north of Etruria. This was
