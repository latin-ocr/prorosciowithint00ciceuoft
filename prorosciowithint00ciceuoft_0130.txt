two words. We may render the first of them ‘ farms,' and the second
‘ estates? They are used quite interchangeably in this speech. Cp.
sor instance ξ 99 with ἐξ 17, 21. For the legal meaning of ‘ fundus '

a. Neque haee tu non intelligis,‘ and it is not that you do not

⁸ understand these things. Cicero here compliments the intelligence

of Erucius at the expense of his honesty. In the 2nd Philippic (5 19)
he acquits Antony of audacity and impudence at the expense of his in-
telligence—‘haec tu non propter audaciam dicis tam impudenter,
sed quia tantam rerum repugnantiam non vides!

b. ut non modo tibi contra nos, etc. Cp. Phil. ΙΙ, § 18—‘ tam

as in 5 47—‘cum et illud incertum sit.' Cp. ξ 4 a.

g. in bonam partem accipias. Cp. Pro Arch. ξ 32. The
meaning is fairly reflected by our own phrase, ‘to take in good

part.’

, a. certo, ‘whom you can identisy.' Cp. De Div. I, ξ 2, where

Cicero is speaking of uncivilised man—‘non certos quisquam aspex-

erat liberos?
b. humanitatis non parum, ‘your full share of human feeling.'

Here opposed to studium doctrinae, with which it is so often
identified, e. g. in § 121.
