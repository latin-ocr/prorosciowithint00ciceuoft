PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 21—23.

d. propria, ‘as his own. ' The farms which Magnus (‘ iste ’) oe·
cupied were taken' m the name of Chrysogonus,

e. quae hodie possidet. This clause states an additional fact,
and is therefore coordinate with the preceding. Were it turned
into the oblique narration, the verb would be put in the infinitive.
Translate—‘ And these farms he is in possession of at this moment?

f. nomine Chrysogoni. Cp. ξ 23 ‘ procurator Chrysogoni.’

g. Haec bona, etc. Cp. ξ 6, from whence these words are thought
to be interpolated.

, a. neque enim mirum, etc. Cp. the whole passage which fol-

lows with the still grosser flattery of 5 131.

b. et ea quae praeterita sunt . . . . praeparet. Unless some-
thing has dropped out, we have here a very bold zeugma. Translate
by some neutral word such as ‘ attend to.'

c. si aliquid non animadvertat, ‘ if something should escape
his notice.' The words depend upon ‘neque enim mirum’ (supply
⁶ est ’). The emphatic nature of the pronoun accounts for the shorter
form ‘quid’ not being employed, as usual, after ‘si.’ Cp. Pro
Mil. ξ 66—‘ cavebat . . . . Pompeius . . . . omnia, ne vos aliquid
timeretis.’ So in De Sen. ᾗ 44—‘ sed si aliquid dandum est volup-
tati, quoniam eius blanditiis non facile obsistimus?

d. cum praesertim, ‘ especially aS.’ Cp. ἐξ 51, 66. Cicero
inclines rather to this order of the words ε but the form ‘ praesertim
cum ’ occurs also in the same sense, e.g. Phil. ΙΙ, ξ 64. In the same
way ‘ qui ’ sometimes precedes and sometimes follows ἕ praesertim.'

e. occupationem eius observent, ‘ are watching to find him
employed‚’ i.e. too much engrossed in state business to attend to
their doings.

f. tempusque aucupentur. Literally ‘ are fowling for an op-
portunity ' ; the equivalent metaphor in English is ‘ fishing sor!

g. despexerit, ‘ let his glance drop,’ i. e. taken his eyes off them.
This appears to be the only passage in which the word is used in
this sense τ but it is quite intelligible as opposed to ‘ circumspicere,'
which denotes vigilance. The usual phrase is ‘ oculos deiicere.’

lz. felix. After the defeat and death of the younger Marius,
Sulla assumed the sumame of Felix (Vell. Pat. II. 27, § 5). Simi-
larly his son was called Faustus and his daughter Fausta (Plut.
Sull. 34).

i. familia. Here equal to ‘ household‚’ including all servants
and retainers. Contrast its use in 5 15.

a. iste ¹1¹. Roscius. Magnus, who was present in court.

b. vir optimus. Used in the same sarcastie way in ξ 104 ad in.
