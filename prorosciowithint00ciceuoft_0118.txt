PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξς 23-25.

0. constituta, etc.. ‘ he held an auction and sold?

a. ne iter quidem, etc. This is not a mere rhetorical flourish,
but refers to a legal technicality. When land changed hands, the
former owner would generally reserve a right of access to his family
sepulchre. The ‘fundus' was then said ‘servire,’ and this limita-
tion of ownership was known as ‘servitus’ Digest XLVII. 12.
ξ 5- ‘Utimur eo iure, ut dominis fundorum, in quibus sepulchra
fecerint, etiam post venditos fundos adeundorum sepulchrorum sit
ius.’

b. sepulcrum patrium, ‘his family burying-place.'

c. reliquisset. Subjuncfive, because it is one of the things
which are said to have presented themselves to the minds of the
‘ Amerini.’

d. possessio, ‘occupation.' Cp. ξ 15 ‘possident'

e. furta, rapinae. The first of these words refers back to
‘ plura clam de medio removebat‚’ the second to ‘multa palam
domum suum aufereba .’

f. ardere illa. omnia mallet. The ‘illa' was added to the
text by later editors, because the words are thus quoted by the
grammarian Julius Rufinianus.

g. in ...... bonis iactantem se ao dominantem,
‘swaggering and lording it.’ Cp. Pro Q. ξ 98—‘cum illum in
suis paternis bonis dominari videret! The sentiment is the same
as in De Off. 1, ξ 139—‘ odiosum est enim, cum a praetereuntibus
dicitur: ·

O domus antiqua, heu quam dispari
dominare domino ἔ ’
Cp. Phil. 11, ς 104 -—‘o tecta ipsa misera, “quam dispari do-
mino !'’ ⁹

‚ a. decurionum, ‘of the town-council.’ Cp. Pro Sest. § 10

‘Capuae decuriones' ; Caes. Bell. Civ. I. 13 ad in. ‘Auximi de—
curiones’; Pro Clu. § 41 ‘ decuriones universi.’ The ‘ decuriones ’
were the members of the senate in the ‘ municipia’ and the colonies.
According to the Digest (L. 16, ξ 239, 5) they were so called be-
cause when the colonies were originally led out, a tenth part used to
be chosen as a deliberative body.

b. decem primi, ‘the ten leading men.’ This was a smaller
body chosen out of the ‘ decuriones ⁹ sor the transaction of business.
The number varied. Thus we read of ‘quinque primi' (Verr. ii.
III, ξ 68), ‘ sex primorum ’ (De N. D. ΙΙΙ, ξ 74), ‘ decem primos '
(Verr. ii. 11, ξ 162), ‘ Massiliensium quindecim primos’ (Caes. Bell.
Civ. Ι. 35, ad in.>.
