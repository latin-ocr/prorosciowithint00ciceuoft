PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 74-76.

we think it sufficient to indicate motion once, 5 20 b. This is said
to be the only passage where Cicero uses ⁵ indidem.‘

d. multis annis. This is not a case of duration of time, but of
time within which. We have duration of time i'n the ‘ plus ’ which
follows. With the use of the abl. here ep. the opening of the
Second philippic—⁶ ut nemo his annis viginti reipublicae fuerit
hostis.'

e. Ubi eos convenit Ρ See ξ 50 g.

f. Nonne . . . solet f> ‘ Is it not thus that it is usual for a crime
to be traced to its source ? ’

g. homine quoquam. Cp. ξ 94 ‘quemquam sicarium.' Halm
says that ‘ quisquam ' is never used adjectivally except with names of
persons, whether singular or collective.

Ιι. in oppido. See ξ 52 f.

, a. praetereo. We have here an instance of the. rhetorical device

called ‘occultatio,’ described in the treatise ad Herennium, ξ 37—-
‘ Occultatio est, cum dicimus nos praeterire aut non scire aut nolle
dicere id quod tunc maxime dicimus!

b. victu arido, ‘ plain living! Cp. Pro Q. ξ 93—‘ contra sibi ait
officium, fidem, diligentiam, vitam omnino semper horridam atque
aridam cordi fuisse.’

c. luxuries . . . luxuria.. See} 39 c. Notice how in each clause
a word is repeated from the preceding one before the next word of
importance is introduced. This is the figure κλῖμαξ or ‘ gradatio‚’
as it is called by Cornificius (Ad H. IV, ξ 34), who is followed by
Quintilian (IX. 3, ἐξ 55-57). Cp. Pro Mil. ξ 61.

d. scelera ae maleficia. Not ‘ tautologous.’ ‘ Guilt ’ may exist
in the mind and heart without being realised in action, and so
developing into ‘ maleficium,’ § 30 c.

e. parsimoniae. Cp. Pro Q. ξ 92——‘ rusticana illa atque inculta
parsimonia.’ γ

f. magistra. This is one of those ‘substantiva mobilia,’ which ’
agree, as far as possible, in gender with their noun. See P. S. L. G.
ξ 1 13, 5). For a masculine instance of the same word we may take
the ‘ venter magister artium ' of Persius.

‚ a. missa facio. A periphrasis for ‘ mitto? Cp. Ad H. II, ξ 2 5

—‘ si eum missum fecerimus.'

b. illud. See ς 52 d.

c. qui . . . fuerit, ‘ seeing that, as you say, he has never mixed
with his fellow—men.' Contrast with this the use of the indic. to
state a fact in ξ 74 ‘ qui Romam, etc.’

d. tute. Cp. ἐξ 81, 94; Verr. Div. ς 27-——‘ tute tui periculum
