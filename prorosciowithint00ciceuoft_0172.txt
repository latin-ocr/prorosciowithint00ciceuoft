ξ 131.

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTEs. ᾗῇ 129-131.

b. qua. condicione. See 5 144.

a. optimi, ‘ most loyal.'

b. in eos solos. Supply ‘ qui aut proscripti aut apud adversarios
occisi sunt.'

c. aliquanto= ‘ aliquot post mensis ' in ξ 128.

d. quae dies. See § 128 b; § 28e.

e. tantulo. Cp. Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. iii. 156—‘ Quanti emptae?' ‘Parvo.'
The gen. of price is confined to certain adjectives—‘ tanti,’ ‘ quanti,’
‘ pluris,' ‘ minoris ' and a few others; the rest take the abl.

f. venierint. Notice that this is the fourth clause ending with
the same word ‘ venierint.' This is not accident, but design. The
device is called in the Ad H. (IV, ξ 19) ‘conversio '—‘ conversio
est, per quam non, ut ante, primum repetimus verbum, sed ad
postremum continenter revertimur)

g. nequam. See ξ 38 f.

lz. nihil egerit. The fut. perf. contemplates the action as com-
plete—‘ he will find that he has effected nothing.'

a. Etenim si Iuppiter, etc. In the passage which follows we
have a soretaste of the adulation of the Empire. Cp. ξ 22.

b. caelum, terra. mariaque. Only two ideas, according to Land-
graf, ‘heaven and earth’: but it is perhaps better to admit that
‘que' is -osten attached to the last only of a string of words. Cp.
ξ 71-—‘ caelum, solem, aquam terramque ;' ξ 109——‘ totam vitam,
naturam moresque.’ So Verr. Div. ξ 72—‘ sudore, labore vigiliisque ’
and numberless other instances.

c. pernicii causa, ‘out of mischief. ‘Pemicii' is an archaic
form of the genitive, sor ‘ perniciei.’ Aulus Gellius (IX. 14) quotes
the present passage in proof of the existence of an old genitive in
‘ -ii ' from nouns in ‘ -es,’ whether of the 3rd or 5th decl„ of which
he gives many examples from ancient authors, as ‘ sacii‚’ ‘ dii,’
‘ samii,' contracted into ‘ fami ’ (from ‘ fames ’), ‘ progenii,' ‘ luxurii‚’
‘ acii,’ ‘ specii? He is of opinion that ‘ dii,' as the gen. from ‘diei,’
is the true reading in the hemistich in Vergil (Aen. I. 636)—

‘munera laetitiamque dii‚‘
a view which Servius also notices.

d. sed vi ipsa. We have here the dualistic notion of a Deity
struggling with the intractability of matter.

e. magnitudine rerum. Corresponding to the ‘propter mag-
nitudinem rerum' above.

f utimur . . . fruimur, ‘the advantages whereof we avail our-
selves and the light we revel in.’

g. aliqua . . . animadvertere, ‘ to notice one or two things.’
