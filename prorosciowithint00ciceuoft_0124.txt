PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾗῇ 33, 34.

gestion of Marius. His blood stained the portals of the temple of
Vesta (Liv. Epit. 82 : Cic. De Orat. III, ᾖ 10). Scaevola was
one of the chief founders of Roman law,

d. laude. See ξ 2 b.

e. locus est ut. A constr. similar to ‘ convenit ut,' ‘ tempus est
ut,' etc.

f. diem . . . dixit. Cp. Pro Mil'. ξ 36—-‘ diem mihi, credo,
dixerat! The ‘diei dictio ’ was a formal notice of an intention to
accuse a man on a specified day before the people. In this case we
may assume that the accusation was never actually brought.

g. tandem. ‘ Tandem ' imparts an air of surprise and impatience
to a question—‘ what on earth ? ’

h. quem pro dignitate, ete„ ‘ whom no one could find words to
praise as he deserved.’ The whole sentence is thus paraphrased by
Valerius Maximus (IX. 11, ξ 82>-‘ Interrogatus deinde quid de eo
secus dicturus esset, cui pro sanctitate morum satis digna laudatio
reddi non posset, respondit se obiecturum illi, quod parcius corpore
telum recepisset.’

τ’. quod non totum, etc. Because he had not, like a gallant
gladiator, bared his breast to receive the final blow. Cp. Pro Sest.
ξ 80—‘ num ut gladiatoribus imperari solet, ferrum non recepit ’ἐ -’

j. quo. The relative extends to the whole incident just de-
tailed. ·

k. potuit. This ls perhaps the aorist, which is followed by the
perfect, in place of the imperfect, whenever stress is meant to be laid
upon a consequence as actually realised.

l. omnis . . . adflixerit. This is explained by the words which
follow. Cicero seems to have thought that Scaevola was the one
man who might have mediated between the contending parties. His
own politics were perhaps derived from Scaevola.

m. quos quia, etc„ ‘ owing to his wish to save whom by effecting -
an agreement, he was himself slain by them? The construction is
a little loos'e. ‘ Eis’ apparently refers to the same subject as‘ quos,’
while m reality it is confined to the adherents of Marius.

n. compositionem. Cp. ξ 136‘ ut componeretur, 'and Phil. ΙΙ.
5 24—‘ pacis concordiae, compositionis auctor esse non destiti.'

, a. Estne. Here equivalent to ‘ nonne est.' Cp. ὁ 66 a.

b. Illud quia, etc. This clause is not interrogative, but con-
cessive—‘ the other outrage, I grant you, seems shocking, because
it was committed in the case of Scaevola z but is this to be endured
merely because it is done by Chrysogonus? '

c. locus, ‘topic.' Cp. ξ 78 ad fin. In this sense the pl. is ‘loci.'
