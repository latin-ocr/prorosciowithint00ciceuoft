ξ 39. Early Roman writers on rhetoric.

Before either Cicero or Cornificius wrote, the subject of
rhetoric had attracted Roman writers. The first to treat of
it was no less a person than Cato the Censor. After him
M. Antonius, the grandfather of the less justly celebrated
Mark Antony, published an unfinished work on the subject.
There were also some minor writers on rhetoric before

Cicero ¹.

ξ 40. The Art of Hermagoras.

But the Greeks had left little for the Romans to d0‚ as is
shown by the exceedingly modest claims to originality put
forth by the Roman writers ². In fact the whole study was
already mapped out for them with even an excessive degree
of minuteness ³. The ‘ art’ most in vogue in Cicero's time
⁴ was that of Hermagoras, which almost saved men the trouble
'¹ of thinking. It was the speaker's vade-mecum, and was as
celebrated at this period as the Art of Theodorus of Gadara
later on 4. The would-be pleader had only to turn over its
pages in order to find the arguments suited to his case: it
was difficult for him to go astray‚ so elever was the system
on which it was devised. But while admirable as an aid to
invention, it did not give much help towards attaining the
graces of diction ⁵, and Tacitus pronounced it to be very dry ⁶.

¹ Quint. iii. 1, ἐξ 19—21.

² Cicero claims the credit of novelty only for having incorporated
some logical rules of division into his treatment of Partitio; we
have seen how humble were the pretensions of C ornificius.

³ Ad H. i. 1, ς 1; Quint. iii. 11, ξ 22.

4 Juv. Sat. vii. 177.

⁵ Brut. 5 263—‘ Ex hac inopi ad ornandum, sed ad inveniendum
expedita Hermagorae disciplina: ea dat rationes certas et praecepta
dicendi : quae si minorem habent apparatum, sunt enim exilia, tamen
habent ordinem et quasdam errare in dicendo non patientes vias.’

⁶ Dial. de Orat. 19.
