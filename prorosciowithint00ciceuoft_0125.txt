PRO SEX ROSCIO. NOTES. §gs 34-37.

ι d. 'I'otam eausam. At this point Cicero enters upon that part of

the speech which is called by himself ⁶ partitio ’ (De Inv. Ι, ξς 19, 31)

and by Cornificius (Ad H. I, §5 4, 17) ‘divisi0.’ This part was

designed to effect two objects: (1) to set clearly before the minds

ι of the judges what points were agreed upon between the contending

partieS, and what points were in dispute; (2) to lay down the order

of treatment beforehand under definite heads, so that thehearers
might know when to expect the peroration.

e. expositam. A variation for ‘ explicatam) Cp. ξ 32 d.

fl quae res totum iudicium contineat, ‘ what is the gist of the
whole trial.’ The technical name for this was the ‘ iudicatio.’ In the
case of a question of fact, or ‘constitutio coniecturalis‚' like the
present, the ‘ iudicatio' coineided with the ‘ quaestio.' De Inv. I,
5 193 ΙΙ, 5 15-

g. sequi, ‘to keep in view.’ De Inv. ΙΙ, 5 126—‘quo in loco
iudici demonstrandum est, quid iuratus sit, quid sequi debeat'3 Ad
H. II, ξ 13—,‘ quid iudicem sequi conveniat' ; Verr. Div. ξ 10—‘ utin
constituendo accusatore quid sequi possitis habeatis.' The same
sense is expressed in other words in Pro Mil. ξ 15—‘ Cn. Pompeius
. . . statuisse videtur, quid vos in iudicando spectare oporteret,' i.e.
has determined the ‘ iudicati0.’

a. quantum ego existimare possum, ‘as far as I can make§ 35. .
out.'

b. quae obstent, ‘ to stand in the way of.'

c. Erucius. This may be the same person who appears to have
acted as accuser in the case of L. Varenus, and against whom a good
saying is recorded : ⁶ Erucius hic noster Antoniaster est,’ which means
that he was a spurious imitation of the great orator Antonius. See
Fragm. Pro Vareno, 10, and cp. Quint. viii. 3, 5 22. Fleckeisen
suggested that the name may be a Latinised form of Ἐρύκιος from
Ἔρυξ, and the owner of it a Sicilian Greek by extraction. The ‘ u ’
in that case will be short.

a. ideo quod, ‘ for this reason that? ξ 36.

ὀ.- ego crimen oportet diluam. For ‘oportet ut ego crimen
diluam.' By this constr. a much greater emphasis is gained for the
pronoun than if the words had been ‘me crimen oportet diluere?

‘Ego crimen diluere debeo ’ would have been equally emphatic:
but the verb ‘debere ’ was wanted below.

c. exstinguere atque opprimere. The metaphoris from stamp-
ing out a flame.

a. maleficio. A variety for ‘facinore.’ Cp. ξ 30 c. ξ 37.

b. seelera omnia, ‘ all sorts of guilt.’ Abstract nouns admit
