PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 97-99.

b. excutio. To realise the appropriateness of this word, we have
to bear in mind that the Romans were accustomed to carry things in
the folds (‘ sinus ’) of the toga, which thus served as pockets.

c. sumo . . . dat. Terms derived from dialectic or logie.

d. Fac, ‘ suppose.’

e. audisse. Supply ‘ eum.’ Cp. ξ 84 c.

f sua. sponte, ‘ of ¹his own accord.' The defective noun ‘ sponte '
seems to be connected with ‘ pondus,’ giving the idea of a thing
falling by its own weight. ⁷

g. id. temporis, ‘ at such a time.’ Cp. 5 64 ‘id aetatis.’ In the
Ad H. 1, 5 21 we have it in the more intelligible form ‘per id
temporis.'

lz. argumentatio. In Part. Orat. θ 45 ‘ argumentatio ' is declared
to mean ‘ argumenti explicatio.’ Cp. De Inv. I, § 74, where the
word is said to have two meanings (1) the bare proof itself, whether
probable or necessary, (2) the same dressed out by rhetoric. The
word is a translation of the Greek ἐπιχείρημα. Ad H. ΙΙ, ξ 2-
‘ argumentationes, quas Graeci ἑπιχείρηματα appellant?

a. Nonne vobis, etc. The passage which follows is one of great ξ 98.
rhetorical power and subtlety. Without committing himself to any
definite statement, Cicero impresses his own view of the case upon
the minds of his hearers by a rapid and lively series of questions.
The graphic description of an event by bringing out the details
is called by Cornificius (Ad H. IV, ξ 68) ‘demonstratio.’ He
defines it thus—‘ cum ita verbis res exprimitur, ut geri negotium et
res ante oculos esse videatur! Cicero himself in the De Oratore

 

ΙΙΙ, ξ 202, speaks of the same thing—‘ nam et commoratio una in re
permultum movet et inlustris explanatio rerumque, quasi gerantur,
sub aspectum paene subiectio,' from which place Quintilian probably
took his ‘ sub oculos subiectio,' a phrase which he ascribes to Cicero
(Inst. Orat. IX. 2, ξ 40). Cp. the passage in the Pro Milone (ᾗ 64)
beginning—‘ si haec non gesta audiretis, sed picta videretis.’

b. Automedontem. Automedon was the eharioteer of Achilles,
Il. XVI. 145. The name was used, as ‘Jehu’ vis with us, for any
eharioteer. See Juv. Ι. 61—

‘ dum pervolat axe citato
Flaminiam puer Automedon.’

c. honoris sui causa. Cp. ξ 132—‘ cuius honoris causa accusare
se dixit Erucius!

a. Quid erat quod . . . voluerit, ‘ what was the reason why he ξ 99,
wished.’ The certainty of his having wished it is brought out by the
irregular sequence. Cp. ξ 35 k.
