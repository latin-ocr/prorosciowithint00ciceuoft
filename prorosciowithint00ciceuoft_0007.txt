PREFACE.

..ἥς-

ΙΝ preparing this edition of the Pro Roscio two objects
have been before me—to provide everything that seemed
necessary for the full understanding of this particular
speech, and also to make the work serve as a fitting
introduction to the study of Cicero’s speeches generally.

As regards the text, 1 have been content to accept the
one recognised by the University, which is that of Baiter
and Kayser.

In acknowledging my obligations to former editors I
must begin with Mr. J. R. King‚ whose notes in Parker's
Series were for a long time the only ones known to me.
Long’s Commentary has also been consulted with ad-
vantage, and Mr. Donkin’s labours have proved helpful.
Among the Germans I have borrowed a lit'tle from
Richter, a great deal from Halm, and most of all from
Landgraf—no doubt because there wa⁸s most to borrow
from.

In a work like this originality is out of the question:
but, in order to secure a certain amount of independence‚
I took the precaution of writing my own notes before

consulting my predecessors, Mr. King alone excepted. 1
