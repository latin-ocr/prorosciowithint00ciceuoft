PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 25-27.

c. qui vir, ‘what sort of man,’ i. e. how loyal to the cause of the
nobility.

d. conservatas velit. Sulla’s will was law. See 5 125 a. For
the constr. of ‘volo' with a perf. part. pass. cp. § 2, Verr. i, 5 18,
6 nominatum volo.' It is used similarly with an adj. without ‘ esse‚’
e. g. De Inv. ΙΙ, ξ 107 ‘salvum velint.'

e. iam ante. See ᾗ 21 ad fin.

j] et ipse . . . . adlegat, ‘ not only comes to them himself, but
deputes men of rank.’ So Verr. ii. Ι, 5 149 ‘ petit a me Habonius
et amicos adlegat.' We have the corresponding abstract term 6 ad-
legatio ' in Verr. ii. 1, ἓξ 44, 136.

g. vellent esse facturum pollicerentur. Notice how the
verbs are piled together at the end of the sentence. So in 5 26
‘ erant, appromitteret, erediderunt '3 ξ 116 ad fin. ‘ putarunt haberi
oportere; ' ξ 117 6 posse feri videtur? In De Inv. I, ξ 82, Cicero
achieves the reservation of four verbs to the end, ‘ adferetur, haberi
conveniat, ostendetur.’

a. Homines antiqui, ‘men of the old schooL’ Cp. ξ 27 ‘ anti· ξ 26,
qui officii? Between ‘ antiquus ' and ‘ vetus ’ there is the same con-
trast observable as between παλαιός and ἀρχαῖος in Greek, the former
of each pair tending to be used in a good, and the latter in a bad,
sense. But nene of these words is rigorously restricted to either
meaning.

b. ¹1¹. Roscius Capito. The position of T. Roscius Capito is
difficult to understand, owing tothe whole of the facts not being
before us. We may infer that he was not at this time in possession
of the three fanns, as mentioned in ς 21.

c. appromitteret‚ ‘added his promise ’-ἄπαξ εἰρημένον; but
‘ appromissor ' occurs in legal Latin in the sense of one who gives
secunty.

d. re inorata, ‘without pleading their cause.’ Cp. the phrase
‘ re infecta.’ ‘ Orator ' in old Latin meant the same as the later word
‘ legatus’ (Festus, Mtiller, p. 199).

e. primo . . . . deludere, ‘first the opponents began to put off
the matter every day and talk about “ to-morrow '² (“cras '') ; then
to act in a much more leisurely way and downright delude them.’

f. id quod facile intellectum est, ‘as was readily inferred.'
Cicero does not say that this charge against the opponents was
proved.

a. de amicorum cognatorumque sententia. Cp. Verr.ii. 11, ξ 27,
ς 91 ‘de amicorum hospitumque suorum sententia.’ Before taking
important steps in private life, it was usual sor a Roman to hold a
