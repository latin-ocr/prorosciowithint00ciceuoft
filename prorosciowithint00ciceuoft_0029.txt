II. RHETORICAL. 25

There is no doubt but that Cicero drew largely upon Herma-
goras in composing his De Inventione ¹.

ξ 41. Cause qf the Roman καί sor rhetorio

But if, like other arts and sciences, rhetoric among the
Romans was transplanted from Greece, at least it found a
most congenial soil in Italy. For there were but two studies
in Rome which were the recognised avenues to success in
life. The one was law, the other was oratory ; and of these
two oratOry was admittedly the more important. To the
Greeks knowledge was a joy in itself ; to the Romans it was
the road to power. Hence all the efforts of Roman education
were concentrated upon the one end of cultivating the faculty
of speech.

Let us now take a brief glance at what Cicero in his school
days had been taught to regard as the theory of rhetoric. It
imparts a new interest to his speeches to compare this theory
with his practice.

ξ 42. The genus (gf rhetoric.

To begin with, rhetoric is a branch 2 of that great practical
science which has for its end to secure the good of man. To
the Greeks this science was known as πολιτική ; the Romans
called it civilis scientia.

§ 43. Its sanction and aim.

The function (officium, ἔργον) of rhetoric is to speak in a
manner calculated to persuade; its aim (finis, τέλος) is to
persuade by speaking.

¹ See his apology for not following Hermagoras in a particular
instance (De Inv. i. 5 12), and cp. Quint. iii. 11, ξ 1 with De InV.
i. 5 18.

² According to Aristotle there is a bar sinister in its pedigree, but '

that need not trouble us here. Ar. Rhet. i. 2, ᾖ 7.
