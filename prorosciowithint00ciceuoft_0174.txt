PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξ 133.

d. domus referta. This descriptive nominative is very common·

in Tacitus. Mr. Donkin quotes Vergil, Georg. II. 133, 134—

‘ folia haud ullis labentia ventis;
flos ad prima tenax?

Here the construction is abrupt, as ‘ habet ' with an acc. had preceded.
It is equally abrupt in Pro Mil. ᾗ 64—‘ domus in clivo Capitolino
scutis referta? In both cases the transition seems to be facilitated by
the intervention of a neut. pl. (here ‘ praedia,' there ‘ arma ') which
looks like a nominative.

e. vasis Corinthiis et Deliacis, ‘ vessels of Corinthian and
Delian bronze.’ Cp. Verr. ii. IV, ἐξ 1, 50, 51. Pliny the Elder
complains of the decay of metallic art in his own time. See
N. H. XXXIV, §5 5, 6, where he mentions that it was Verres’ refusal
to surrender his Corinthian vases that led Antony to put him into
the proscription list of B.C. 43.

f. authepsa, αὗθέψης (αὐτός, ἕψω), an automatic boiler.

g. enumeraret. With this reading we may suppose that the sum
had been paid down, and that the auctioneer was counting it out, to
see if it were right. The other reading ‘ enuntiaret ’ would refer
simply to the ‘ praeco ’ crying out the price.

Ιι. caelati argenti, ‘ of embossed silver.' Plate was adorned
with figures in bas-relies, (‘ crustae aut emblemata ’), which could be
put on and taken off at pleasure. Silver thus adorned was called
‘ argentum caelatum’ 3 when devoid of chasing it was called
‘ purum.' The workers of the pure silvei· were called ‘vascularii‚’
while those who made the ornaments were known as ‘ caelatores!

i. stragulae vestis. ‘ Stragula vestis ’ is used here as a collective

noun. Cp. Verr. ii. ΙΙ, ᾗ 35—‘ plena domus caelati argenti optimi
multaeque stragulae vestis3' also Phil. ΙΙ, 5 66—‘ pretiosa vestis.’
As used distributively the term denoted a coverlet or counterpane‚
such as is known among the Greeks at the present day as πάπλωμα.
The manufacture of them was a work of art. Cicero mentions that
Verres had one made for him by a lady of Segesta, called Lamia,
which was completely dyed with purple (cp. Phil. II, ξ 67—-‘ con-
chyliatis Cn. Pompeii peristromatis ’) and which took three years to
finish (Verr. ii. IV, ξ 59).

j. pictarum tabularum, ‘ pictures,' which were done on boards.

k. marmoris. As distinguished from signorum preceding, this

means marble slabs for tables, side-boards, and house omamentation
generally. Marble was in very common use among the Romans

under the Empire. Among the effects of Codrus, ‘ who had nothing‚’
Juvenal reckons a marble slab for the side-board (Sat. III. 203-5).
