PRO SEX. ROSCIO. ‘Nema ξς 64—66.

g. propter, ‘ hard by.’ Adverbial form from ‘prope' Cp.
‘in-ter‚’ ‘sub-ter,' etc. De Inv. II, ξ 14—‘gladium propter ap-
positum.'

h. nomina . . . delata sunt. See ξ 28 c.

i. quemquam. See ς 8 f.
>l a. non modo. Here equivalent to ‘non modo non.' This is§ 65,
usual when the predicate is common to the two clauses, and not ex-
pressed until the last. Contrast with the present passage the words
in ξ 137—‘ et id non modo re prohibere non licet, sed ne verbis
quidem vituperare.’ The same meaning might be expressed without
‘non’ by reserving ‘ licet’ to the end—‘ et id non modo re pro-
hibere, sed ne verbis quidem vituperare licet.’ Here the negative
contained in ‘ ne . . . quidem' would reflect its force back upon the
preceding clause. Cp. the use of οὐχ ὅπως in Greek. Neither
‘non solum’ nor οὔ μόνον can be used in the same way. For
another pair of examples take Verr. ii. I, ξ 90, as contrasted with
ξ 111.

a. Videtisne. See ξ 34 a. Occasionally we find ‘ ne ’ used where ξ 66.
there is a distinct anticipation of an affirmative answer. De Sen.
5 31-‘ videtisne ut apud Homerum saepissime Nestor de virtutibus
suis praedicet? ’ A strong instance is Pro Mil. ξ 38, where we have
to render the repeated ‘ potuitne ' by ‘ could he not? '

b. quos nobis. ⁴ Orestes and Alcmaeon. The story of Orestes
forms the subject of the trilogy of Aeschylus and of the play of
Euripides called by his name. There is no tragedy extant on the
subject of Alcmaeon ; but we know that he was the hero of a lost
play of Euripides (Arist. Eth. Nic. III. (Ι), 5 8). It would be
through Roman adaptations of Greek plays by Ennius, Accius, or
Pacuvius, that the audience whom Cicero is addressing would be
familiar with Orestes and Alcmaeon. Such a subject for spectacular
effect as the blazing torches of the Furies (ξ 67) is not likely to have
escaped the Romans. We know that Ennius wrote a tragedy called
Alcmaeon, and one of the most celebrated of the tragedies of Pacu-
vius was entitled the Dulorestes. Accius was especially devoted to
the imitation of Aeschylus, and may therefore have had a play on
the same subject.

c. patris ulciscendi causa. The following are two lines of the
Alcmaeon of Euripides, preserved by Aspasius in his commentary on
the Nicomachean Ethics—

μάλιστα μὲν μ’ {rt-[7⁸9⁹ ἐπισκήψας πατήρ,
ὅθ’ ἅρματ’ εἰσέβαινον εἰς Θήβας idm.
d. eum praesertim, ‘ and that too though! Cp. 5 22 d.
