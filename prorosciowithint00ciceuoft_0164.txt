PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ῥῷ 111, 112.

c. non modo malitiosius. ‘ I no not say fraudulently.' The

comp. ‘malitiosius‘ is perhaps only to balance ‘neglegentius’
following.

α’. admisisse. See ξ 62 l.

e. mandati, ‘for trust! ‘Mandatum‘ was a species of legal
obligation. It was due to contract; and this contract arose out of
the consent of the parties, as in the case of buying and selling, letting
and hiring, and partnership. But ‘mandatum’ was distinguished
from other contracts by its gratuitous character. Its origin was due
to friendship, and the intervention of payment for the service rendered
at once deprived this contract of its proper character. The person
who got the service performed was termed in later legal phraseology
the ⁸ mandator’ and the person who undertook to perform it was
called the ‘ mandatarius! Either of the parties could bring an action
against the other, the ‘mandator' for the due discharge of the
delegated trust, and the ‘ mandatarius ’ for reimbursement of expense
caused in carrying it out. It is the action on the part of the
‘ mandator ' which Cicero has in view (Dig. XVII. 1 ; Gaii Inst. 111,
ἐς 155-162)-

f. turpe. A ‘iudicium turpe ' was one which involved ‘ infamia‚’
that is to say, in which the accused‚ if the charge were brought

Δ home to him. was degraded from the exercise of his political rights,

without actually ceasing to be a citizen. Pro Clu. 5 119—-‘ turpi
iudicio damnati in perpetuum omni honore et dignitate privantur.’
Among ‘ privata iudicia ’ of this nature Cicero particularises ‘tutelae,
‘ societatis‚’ ‘ rei mandatae,’ and ‘ fiduciae ' (Pro Caecina, ξ 7). They
all fell under the formula ‘ bonae fidei ’—‘ ut inter bonos bene agier
oportet et sine fraudatione ’ De Off. ΙΙΙ, ξ 70.

g. vicaria. . . . supponitur, ‘ confidence in our friends takes the
place of our own exertions.' For the ‘ pleonasm‚’ cp. ξ 153 a.

lz. disturbat vitae societatem. Ἀναιρεῖται ἡ πρὸς ἀλλήλους χρεία
τῶν ἀνθρώπων says Aristotle talking of breach of contracts. Rhet. 1.
15, ξ 22.

τ’. magis utilis. For ‘utilior.' Cp. ‘magis firma suspitione’
Ad H. II, ξ, 8.

a. Quid recipis mandatum, etc. Just. Inst. ΙΙΙ. 26, 5 11—-
‘ Mandatum non suscipere liberum est: susceptum autem consum-
mandum aut quam primum renuntiandum est, ut aut per semet ipsum
aut per alium eandem rem mandator exsequatur.’ The sudden
address to a person other than the judges is what is technically
known in rhetoric as ‘ apostrophe! Quintilian IX. 2, ς 38—-
‘ Aversus quoque a iudice sermo, qui dicitur ἀποστροφή, mire movet.’
