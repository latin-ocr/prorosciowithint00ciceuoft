last his deeds have been brought to light—‘qua re non oportere
hanc rem ex superiore vita spectari, sed superiorem vitam ex hac re
improbari.'

e. omnino, ‘ altogether.'

fi a. gladio, ‘ from the exercise of his profession.' Cp. ‘' ab armis
recedere‚' ἐξ 16, 126.

g. discipulus magistro. Cp. ς 17, where ‘lanista’ was also
used before.

Ιι. gemina. This word has the same force here as the ‘par,'

Orat. ξ 1 18-‘ qui cum in dominos de servis quaeri noluissent, tamen
de incestu et coniuratione, quae {acta me consule est, quaerendum
putaverunt,' with which cp. Pro Mil. ξ 59 and Pro Reg. Deiot. ξ 3.
The worthlessness of the evidence of slax es, when taken on behalf of
