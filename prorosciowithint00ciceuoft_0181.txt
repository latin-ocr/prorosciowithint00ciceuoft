in his defence.’

e. proque eo, quod, ‘ and in view of the fact that?

f. summa res publiea, ‘the highest interests of the state.’

lz. vobis. Addressed to Chrysogonus and his friends.

a. rationem, ‘ department! Messala undertook all the work ξ 149.

χὼειῖ would be done by an attorney under the English system, leaving
the barrister's task to Cicero.

b. M. Messala. The illustrious Messala Corvinus was not born
till B.c. 58. The person intended is no doubt M. Valerius Messala,
who was elected consul B.C. 53. This would make him at least
ten years younger than the orator. Cicero speaks of him as a friend
at the time of his eanvass (‘ Messala noster’ ad Att. IV. 17, ς 3).

c. satis aetatis, i.e. if he had completed his 17th year, Just. Inst. Ι.
6, 5 7 ad fin.

d. aetas. Contracted from ‘ aevitas.' It is used, like the Greek
ἡλικία and our word ‘ age,' for the period of life, whatever that may
be, at which a person is. Here it means ‘ youth,' as in ξ 9. Cp.
Arist. Eth. Nic. Ι. (9), 5 Ιο-οὔπω ’γὰρ πρακτικὸς τῶν τοιούτων διὰ
τὴν ἡλικίαν.

e. sua causa . . . debere. Referring to Messala, the subject of
‘intellegebat' For the expression ‘ sua causa cupere ’ cp. Verr.
Div. ξ 21—‘ qui te neque velle sua causa, nec, si cupias, posse arbi—
trantur'; Ad H. I, ξ 1 ‘tua causa noluisse ’; and for the same use
with ‘debere' cp. Verr. i, ξ 23—‘ quidam, qui se omnia mea causa
debere arbitrabatur?

f. sectorum. The audienee is meant to understand this as ‘ cut·
throats‚’ while it does not necessarily mean more than ‘ brokers.‘

Cp. § 80 d.
g. haee acta res est. See ξ 142 a.
a. ut, . . . ne. See ξ 7a. §150⁸

b. nobis. See 5 7 e.
c. pristina, ‘time-honoured?
d. satius est, ‘it were better.' The classical languages stated
many things categorically which we state conditionally. It is plain
that the better course z's the better, whether we choose to adopt it or
not.
a. sectores ac sicarii. See 5 80 e. ξ 151,
b. ut . . . coniecerit. Epexegetical of ‘hoc.'
