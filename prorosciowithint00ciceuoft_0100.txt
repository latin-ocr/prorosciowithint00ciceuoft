PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. §gs 2—4.

a passage of the Brutus (ᾗ 50) we have both in one sentence,
‘ brevitas autem laus est interdum in aliqua parte dicendi, in universa
eloquentia laudem non habet.’ With ‘ praereptam velim ’ cp. ξ 25,
⁴ conservatas velit?

c. amplitudo. We may render this ‘ dignity ' for want osa nearer
equivalent. But ‘ amplitudo ' and ‘ dignitas ’ differ as ‘ amplus' and
‘ dignus.’ The first refers to the space which a man occupies in the
eyes of his fellows, the second to the value which they are justified
in setting upon him. Our adjective ‘ imposing ’ gives a notion os the
force of ‘ amplitudo! In the De Inventione (ΙΙ, § 166) Cicero de-
fines ‘ amplitudo ' as ‘ potentiae aut maiestatis aut aliquarum copiarum
magna abundantia ; ’ whereas ‘ dignitas ' is declared to be ‘ alicuius
honesta et cultu et honore et verecundia digna auctoritas.’

a. etiamsi, ‘ even granting that.’ The indicative marks a pure

hypothesis. He does not mean to indicate any presumption either
for or against his own παρρησία.

b. exire, ‘ get abroad.'

c. ad rem publicam accessi, ‘entered on public lise.' Cicero
was now only in his twenty-seventh year. He filled the office of
quaestor in his thirty-second year, Β. C. 75. V

d. ignosci adulescentiae. The subj. of ‘ ignosci ' is the same as
that of ⁶ oecultum esse‚' namely, ‘ si quid liberius dixero‚’ so that we
have here the passive of the constr. ‘ignosco hoc tibi.’

e. tametsi . . . sublata est, ‘ although not merely the idea os
pardon, but even the custom of inquii-y has already been abolished
out of the state ’ (owing to the proscriptions). This play on words
between ‘ignoscere ’ and ‘ cognoscere' occurs in Cicero’s juvenile
work, the De Inventione (II, § 105)—‘ et magis in hoc quidem igno-
scendi quam cognoscendi postulatio valuit.’ Itis common also in
other authors. See, for instance, Ter. Haut. 218—

‘Nam et cognoscendi et ignoscendi dabitur peccati locus,’
with which cp. the prologue to the Eunuchus, 42.

The periphrasis ignoscendi ratio supplies the place of a verbal
noun for ‘ pardoning.’ For the Romans had no ‘ignitio ’ from ‘igno-
scere‚’ though they had ‘ cognitio ’ from ‘ cognoscere?

On the discontinuance of trials see Introd. § 24.

a. illa, ‘the following-³ The pronoun ⁶ ille‚' like ἐκεῖνος in Greek,
frequently looks on to what is coming. ξ 52 d.

b. forsitan. Said to be always with the subj. in Cicero.

c. ut . . . ut. The first ‘ ut ’ depends upon ‘ petitum sit,' the
second looks back to ‘ ita.’ ‘ We may add the following reason also,
that the rest perhaps may have been asked to plead ina way that-
