 

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTEs. ξξ 60-62.

b. alias res agere, ‘ to be careless.’ Cp. Brut. ξ 233—‘ut
mirarere tam alias res agere populum ut esset insano inter disertos
locus.' He is talking of Fimbria. See ξ 33 b. The opposite is ‘ hoc
agere,’ ‘ to attend to the thing in hand.’

c. pupugisset. The metaphoris probably from an ox-goad, with
which slaves were sometimes admonished. Cp. Phil. ΙΙ, 5 86—-
‘ num exspectas dum te stimulis fodiamus Ρ ’

d. vexari pessime, ‘ were being roughly handled.'

a. tuam illam. Where a possessive and a demonstrative pronoun ξ 61.
are used of the same person or thing, Cicero often puts the
possessive pronoun first. Cp. ᾗ 101 ‘ suum illud;’ ξ 104
‘vestra ista3' ς 139 ‘nostri isti;‘ Cat. I, ξ 16 ‘quae tua est ista
vita ⁸? '

b. ea spe . . . quod putares, ‘ in the expectation that! ‘ Quod
putares ' only serves to explain ‘ ea spe.’

c. ratio ab accusatore, etc„ ‘ no theory has been offered by the
prosecutor as to the son’s motive for killing his father.' The
necessity of proving a motive was a fundamental axiom of legal
argument. It is part of the wider assumption, which underlies all
reasoning, that no event takes place without a cause. De Inv. II,
ᾗ 19—‘ hic locus sicut aliquod fundamentum est huius constitutionis
(i. e. coniecturalis), nam nihil factum esse cuiquam probatur, nisi
aliquid, qua re factum sit, ostenditur.'

a. noxiis, ‘ trespasses.’ An old legal term. Landgraf says that ξ 62.
Cicero uses it only here in the speecheS.

b. his, ‘with which we are all acquainted.' Cp. ξ 134 ‘hasce
artes vulgares.’ <

c. peccatis, ‘ misdemeanonrs.’

α’. magis erebra. ‘ Crebriora‚’ it would seem, was unpleasing to
the Roman ear. We may gather this from the frequent change os
‘ increbrescere ’ into ‘ increbescere?

ε. in quo scelere, ‘a crime in which.’ So in ξ 27 ‘in qua
muliere,' ‘ a woman in whom! The guilt of parricide was one of
the recognised commonplaces of rhetoric. Cicero says (De Inv. 11,
ξ 48), that it should not be brought in till the charge is established.
But there he is thinking of the accuser z here he is availing himself
of the topic in order to show that the gigantic nature of the guilt
makes the unproved ascription of it ridiculous.

f. convenisse unum in locum, ‘ to coincide.'

g. congruere. In Ter. Haut. 511 we have ‘congrueie’ For the
‘ g’ cp. ‘ ingru0.'

h. testis incertus, ‘ a doubtful witness.’ For the opposite notion
