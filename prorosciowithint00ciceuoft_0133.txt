¹ PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ἕξ 50, 51.

c. qui . . . putes, ‘if you think.'

d. agro colendo= ‘ agri culturae.⁷ The notion of necessity is not
inherent in the gerundive, but arises' out of the constr. of ‘esse ⁷ with
the infin.² which so often accompanies it.

e. flagitium, ‘a moral offence.’ The word is thus distinguished
from ‘facinus ’ by St. Augustine (Conf. ΙΙΙ. 8)—‘Sed quae flagitia
in te, qui non corrumperis? Aut quae adversus te facinora, cui
n'oceri non potest? '

f Atilium. C. Atilius Regulus Serranus, consul for the first time
in B.C. 2 57. He must be distinguished from the still more famous
C. Atilius Regulus, who attained the consulship ten years before
him. The story of Serranus being found at the plough by a deputa—
tion from the senate is told with great unction by Valerius Maximus,
IV. 4, 5 5. Cp. Plin. N. H. xviii. 20. The Ancients derived the
name ‘ Serranus ' from ‘ serere‚' a derivation which Vergil (Aen. VI.
844) has in view when he says -‘ te sulco, Serrane, serentem.'
But it is possible that the story arose out of the name, and not
the name out of the story. There was a town in Umbria called
¹ Saranum.' .

g. convenerunt. ‘Convenire aliquem’ is a common constr„ in
spite of its grammatical irregularity. Cp. ξ 74 ‘ubi eos convenit ’ἒ ’

lz. hercule. Ἡράκλεις.

i. ceteris. E. g. Μ’ Curius Dentatus and L. Quinctius Cincinna-
tus. See De Sen. §§ 55, 56.

j. suos enim agros, etc. The spread of the Roman empire was
certainly not due to agriculture: but what Cicero means is that it
was helped on by the absence of domestic feuds which enabled the
Romans to combine against foreigners. There is perhaps a reference
intended to the quartering of Sulla's soldiers over Italy.

a. eo . . . quo, ⁶ on the ground that! ᾗ 51,

b. illud. See 4 a.

c. summi viri clarissimique homines. ‘Homo’ is a human
being, as opposed to a god, or a beast3 ‘ vir’ is a man, as opposed
to a woman, and so it is often used with special reference to
conduct in public life. Cp. Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ς 19—‘et virum
optimum et hominem improbissimum esse diceres ; ’ Ver. Div. ξ 56—
‘ quaestori Caecilio, viro optimo et homini aequissimo ; ’ Verr. ii. Ι,
ξ 67——‘ iactatur domi suae vir primarius et homo honestissimus;'
Paradox, ᾗ 16—‘ C. vero Marium vidimus, qui mihi secundis rebus
unus ex fortunatis hominibus, adversis unus ex summis viris vide-
batur!

d. gubernacula. In the metaphorica] sense the pl. is usual. Cp.
