PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 32‚33.

d. iugulastis3 occisum. ‘Occisum’ is for ‘ iugulatum,’ for

- the avoidance of monotony. Sometimes the bare repetition of the

word has more force, e. g. Ter. And. 298—‘accepi; acceptam
servabo.'

e. subsellia.. On which the jurors sat. Cp. ξ 12 ad fin.

f condemnetis, ‘ get condemned.’ Pro Clu. 5 9—‘ Corrupisse
dicitur A. Cluentius iudicium pecunia, quo inimicum innocentem
Statium Albium condemnaret.'

a. Hominem longe audacissimum, etc„ ‘by far the most ξ 33.
audacious man that we have had of late among us was C. Fimbria.'

b. G. Fimbriam. A prominent member of the Marian party.
Everything that we hear of him is in keeping with the account of
Cicero. In the epitome of Livy 82 he is described as ‘ultimae
audaciae homo‚’ and Velleius Paterculus speaks of his character as a
mixture of villainy in design and audacity in execution (ΙΙ. 24, ὅ Ι).
The fullest account of him is to be found in Appian (Bell. Mith.

 

51-3, 59, 60). Being sent out to aid the consul L. Valerius Flaccus
(13.0. 86) in carrying on the war against Mithridates, in opposition
to Sulla, who had been declared a public enemy, Fimbria raised a
mutiny against his commander, and had him murdered. He then
assumed the command himself, and for some time prosecuted the
war with a vigour stained by cruelty. One of his exploits was the
treacherous destruction of the city of Troy. Fimbria’s success
deserted him when he came into contact with the fortune of Sulla.
His own soldiers refused to support him, while those os Sulla derided
him as a usurper. At last he stabbed himself in the temple of
Aesculapius at Pergamus, and was fain to supplicate a slave to
complete his destruction. It is doubtless this Fimbria whose
eloquence Cicero characterises as that of a madman. Brut. ς 2 33.
c. Q. Scaevola, i.e. ‘ Q. Mucius Scaevola, Publii filius‚' who was
‘pontifex maximus.’ He must be distinguished from the augur of
the same name, who was also a lawyer of repute. Cicero studied
law first under the augur and then under the pontifex (De Am.
ξ 1). Of the latter, with whom we are here concemed, he always
speaks in terms of the highest admiration. Take for instance the
words in the De Amicitia—‘ quem unum nostrae civitatis et ingenio
et iustitia praestantissimum audeo dicere,’ and the elegant compli-
ment which he makes Crassus pay him in the De Oratore (I, ξ 180)
—‘juris peritorum eloquentissimus, eloquentium iuris peritissimus.’
Scaevola lived for four years after the attempt on his life which is
narrated in the text. But in the consulship of the younger Marius,
B.C. 82, he was murdered by the praetor Damasi, pus, at the sug-
