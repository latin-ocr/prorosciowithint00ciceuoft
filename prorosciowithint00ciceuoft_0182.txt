§ 153.

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 151-154.

c. de improviso. Cp. Verr. ii. Ι, 5 112 ‘ ex improviso?

d. bonorum emptores. Doubtless the resemblance in sound to
‘ boni imperatores ’ is intentional.

e. prohibeant . . . ut. ‘Ut‚' instead of ‘ ne‚’ with ‘prohibere’
is a construction almost without parallel.

f consilium publicum, ‘the court of the people.’ Cp. ἐ 8
‘ ex senatu in hoc consilium.’

a. obstare, ‘against him,' as we should say.

a. instaurata. Translate ‘set on foot.' The word means ‘to
do a thing again,' but this is already implied by ‘ nova.' We have
similar pleonasms in ⁴ unus relictus . . . restat ' ξ 133 ‘ vican‘a fides
amicorum supponitur ' ξ 111.

b. senatus suscipere noluit. Sulla had it carried out without
consulting them—owart τῶν ἐν τέλει κοινωσάμενος Plut. Sull. 31.

c. more maiorum. It was provided in the Twelve Tables that

· no Roman citizen should be put to death except by a vote of the

§154.

‘ comitia centuriata.’

d. publico consilio. Perhaps not ‘ by the public council,’ but
‘ by the authority of the state,’ asin Livy XXI. 18, §6—‘ Ego autem
non, privato publicone consilio Saguntum oppugnatum sit quaerendum
censeam, sed utrum iure an iniuria?

e. puerorum. Common gender.

f. perventuram putetis. A· refinement‚ after the manner of
Cicero, on the simple ‘ respublica perventura sit? Cp. the common
ending, ‘ esse videatur,' where ‘ sit ' would be sufficient.

a. domestica crudelitate. See Introd. ἐς 3-11.

b. consuetudine incommodorum, ‘ through familiarity with
distress!

c. adsiduitate molestiarum, ‘ from the constant presence of
suffering?
