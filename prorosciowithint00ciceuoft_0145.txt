e. non. . . deicere. Supply ‘voluerunt ' from ‘ noluerunt' above.

fl sic nudos, ‘naked as they were.' Halm quotes Livy ΙΙ. 10
ad fin.--‘ Ita sic armatus in Tiberim desiluit.’ ³

g. mare . . . polluerent. Cp. the expression of the same thought
in Shakespeare’s Macbeth (Act ii. sc. 2)—

‘Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood

Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather

The multitudinous seas incamadine,

Making the green—one red.’

h. expiari, ‘ to be cleansed? Eur. Iph. in Taur. 1193—
θάλασσα κλύζει πάντα τάνθρώπων κακά.
Ovid in his Fasti derides the notion of purification by water—
‘Heu miseras gentes, qui tristia crimina caedis

fluminea tolli posse putatis aqua ! ’

a. Etenim quid est, etc. On this passage see Introd. ᾖ 29. ξ 72.

b. fluctuantibu8‚ 6 to the wave—tossed.’

c. Ita vivunt . . . ut, etc„ ‘they live while they can, without
being able.’ Cp. ξ 55 d.

d. ad saxa. This might be explained as a pregnant construction
-‘ to come to the rocks and find rest there.’ But probably it is an
instance of that use of ‘ ad ’ in which it simply indicates the where-
abouts of a thing, so that we may translate ‘ on the rocks‚⁷ cp. §44 a.

e. crimen, ‘charge'

f. diligentius paratiusque venisses, ‘ you ought to have
studied your case more carefully before' you appeared.’ Cicero
wishes to impress upon the judges that Erucius was treating them
like a parcel of old women. For ‘paratius’ cp. Phil. ΙΙ, § 79— ¹
‘invectus est copiosius multo in istum et paratius Dolabella quam
nunc ego.’ 6 Venisses' is not the conditional, but the ‘ jussive con—
junctive.’

a. quid agatur, ‘what the case is.‘ ξ» 73,

b. admittere. See ,δ 62 l.

c. Esto, ‘ Let that pass.’ A formula of transition.

d. sie tecum agam. It seems to be only to avoid monotony that
6 sie' is used here in place of 6 ita.’

e. meo loco. Cp. Verr. ii. 1, §25—‘ de meis legitimis horis.'
It is like the ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ὕδατι of the Greek orators (e. g. Dem. de

Cor. p. 274).

“ b. servosne. Supply 6 per’ from the per alios preceding. So

in the case of ‘ quos homines? ’
