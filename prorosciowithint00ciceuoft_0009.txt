Ι. HISTORICAL.

ξ 1. Hz‘storical z'mportance of Cz'cero’s speeches.

THE speeches of Cicero are like a gallery of historical
paintingS‚ portrayed indeed in the vivid colours of rhetoric,
lurid οι· gorgeous as'¹ the case may be, but, for all that,
preserving in outline a faithful image of the features of the
times. We have now a great provincial governor brought
before the bar of public justice or a revelation of a deep—laid
conspiracy against the state 3 anon we have an appalling
glimpse into the depravity of social life in Italy3 or perhaps
some weighty measure of public policy is debated before us3
or the personal grievances of the orator are dwelt on, whose
life was inseparable from the public life of Rome. Most of
the speeches breathe the full confidence of popular favour3
a few have the guarded discretion required under a dictator-
ship; while at the close we have a trumpet-call to liberty,

until the lips of the orator are sealed in dust.

ᾗ 2. The Pro Roscio the first that deals dz'rectly wz'tlz
polz'tz’cs.

Of this series the Pro Sexto Roscio Amerino may be con-
sidered the first. For the Pro Quinctio, which precedes it,

” though it throws an interesting side-light on the state of

political feeling at Rome, is occupied with the private affairs
of a pair of partners‚ who quarrelled over a sheep-farming
business in Gaul.
