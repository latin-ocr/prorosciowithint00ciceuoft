J. HISTORICAL. 1 7

would stand and stare, or like the English farmer, who, on
arriving at Rome, asked to be shown the pig-market. But
it is easy for Cicero to show that there is a very long interval

between all this and parricide. So, after twitting Erucius on
the carelessness with which he had got up his case, Cicero

proceeds to bring home the charge of murder to the accuser’s
own clients, and winds up with a scornful denunciation of the
insufferable arrogance of Chrysogonus.

ξ 28. Acquz'ttal os tlze accused.

The result was the acquittal of the accused on the charge
of parricide, which was all that Cicero dared to ask for. The
great injustice of his being robbed of his property was left
unrighted. For that was done with Sulla’s sanction, and
Sulla's acts had the force of law.

ξ 29. Cicero's retirement after his success.

This case was Cicero's great opportunity, and greatly did
he avail himself of it. Thenceforward his fame was made.

The passage especially upon the punishment of parricide1 ..

won him enthusiastic applause 2, uttered as it was with all the
vehemence of tone and gesture, which characterized Cicero's
early style of declamation ³. So great indeed was the strain
upon his physical powers caused by his manner of delivery,
that his friends and physicians, fearing danger to life, advised

¹ Brut. ς 312—‘ Itaque prima causa publica pro Sexto Roscio
dicta tantum commendationis habuit, ut non ulla esset quae non
digna nostro patrocinio videretur.’

² His own more mature judgment led him to regard the style as
somewhat crude. Orator, § 107—‘Quantis illa clamoribus adu-
lescentuli diximus de supplicio parricidarum? Quae nequaquam
satis defervisse post aliquanto sentire coepimus. “ Quid enim tam
commune . . . conquiescant '' et quae sequuntur. Sunt enim omnia
sicut adulescentis non tam re et maturitate quam spe et exspec-
tatione laudati.' Cp. Quint. xii. 6, ἐξ 3, 4.
