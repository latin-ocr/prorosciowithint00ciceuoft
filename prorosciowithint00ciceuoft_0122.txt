times it is used in the sense of ‘ exposed to hostility‚’ as here and in
Pro Plancio, ς 1—‘ si huius salus ob eam ipsam causam esset
infestior, quod is meam salutem . . . texisset.’ The word forms
the text of a chapter in Aulus Gellius (IX. 12) on expressions which
admit of reciprocal and opposite meanings, such as ‘ formidolosus:
‘invidiosus‚' ‘suspitiosus‚' ‘gratiosus,’ ‘laboriosus‚' ‘nescius,' ‘ig-
narus‚' etc.—‘nam et is ‘s‘ infestus,'’ dicitur, qui malum infert
cuipiam; et contra, cui aliunde impendet malum, is quoque
“ infestus '' dicitur.' '

b. ferro atque insidiis, ‘by secret violence! A hendiadys.
Cp. ξ 8 ‘sententias iusque iurandum,’ ᾖ 9 ‘natura pudorque,’

after ‘ consilium ceperunt ' in ξ 28.

s. cervices. Varro (L. L. VIII, ξ 14 ; cp. X, ξ 78) mentions that
Hortensius ‘in his poems ' deviated from custom in using this word

Here we may render it ⁵ throat.’ Cp. the parallel expression in the
Pro Milone, ξ 31—‘ optabilius Miloni fuit dare iugulum P. Clodio.’

g. culeum, ‘ a sack.’ On the punishment of parricides see § 70 l.

lz. desunt. In ξ 5 Cicero had said ‘ego huic causae patronus
exstiti.’ Here he professes to regard himself as unworthy the title
of ‘ patronus ’ in comparison with the men who might have under-
taken the defence.

ξ 31 to cap the climax of ‘ libenter, audacter!

expression as ‘ita me Hercules iuvet.’

Cp. ξ 83 ‘ quod certum est non facere! ‘Certus ' may be a parti-
ciple from ‘ cerno.’ Cp. '‘ tersus ' from ‘ tero‚’ by the side of ‘ tritus.'

d. nulla res tanta, etc„ ‘ no such emergency shall arise as to
make it possible for sear to be more powerful with me than honour.’

ξ 32, α. tam dissoluto animo, ‘so slack.' Cp. Pro Q. ᾖ 38—‘ quis
