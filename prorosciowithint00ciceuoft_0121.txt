 

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ῥῷ 28-30.

e. in qua re. The repetition of the antecedent imparts a some-
what formal and precise air to a statement. Caesar is particularly
addicted to the practice, e. g. Bell. Gall. I. 6-‘ diem dicunt, qua
die,’ etc. So in many passages in Cicero, e.g. Verr. ii. ΙΙ, ξ 37-
‘ dies advenit, quo die, etc. ; De Inv. Ι, ᾗ 29 ad fin.—‘ad eam rem,
qua de re narrabitur;' ibid. II, ξ 82—‘ postulabit ut legem, qua
lege fecerit, proferat.' -

f. nulla subesset suspitio, ‘there was no hint of a suspicion.’

g. tempore ipso, ‘ bn the circumstances of the times‚’ explained
by what follows—‘ ita loqui homines,’ etc.

lz. Ita loqui homines. In the oblique narration, because it is
what the opponents (⁴ isti ') are represented as thinking.

z'. patronos. We may say ‘ counsel.' See ξ 5 b.

j. de bonorum venditione. Cp. ἓ 58.

k. societate. See ξ 20 τ’.

l. atrocitate, ‘ blackness.’ ‘ Atrox ’ is said to come from ¹ ater‚'
as ‘ ferox ' from ‘ ferus.’

m. fore ut tolleretur=fut. infin. pass„ ‘ sublatum iri.'

n. ab nullo. ‘ Nullo ' and ‘ nullius’ are used in place of the abl.
and gen. respectively of ‘ nemo.'

a. atque adeo. These particles are used in correcting one ξ 29
expression by another, generally by ⁸a stronger one. So ξ 100
‘si prodierit, atque adeo ’ (or rather I should say) ‘ cum prodierit,’
ξ 113 ‘inter honestos homines atque adeo inter vivos.' In ξ 110
ad fin. we have ‘ ac potius ' in the same sense. Comificius <Ad H.
IV, ξ 36) enumerates ‘correctio’ among the devices of rhetoric.
One of his examples is this—‘ o virtutis comes invidia, quae bonos
sequeris plerumque atque adeo insectan's! '

b. iugulandum, ‘ to cut his throat,’ or perhaps rather ‘ to throttle
him.' Cp. the words used by Sallust (Cat. 55)—‘ vindices rerum
capitalium . . . laqueo gulam fregere.'

c. querar. Deliberative conjunctive, like the verbs that follow.

d. quod. N otice that this is the adjectival form of the interroga-
tive3 with the substantial form we should have ‘ quid auxilii.’

e. Deorumne, etc. This is not a disjunctive interrogation, but a
number of independent questions massed together for rhetorical
effect—‘ Am Ι to implore at this moment the protection of the
gods? Am I to implore that of the Roman people2 etc.’

a. infesta, ‘rendered unsafe.’ The word has the form and osten ᾗ 30,
the force of a participle. In Verr. ii. Ι, §93 ad fin. it appears to
mean ‘ rendered hostile ’—-‘ hi, qui decretis edictisque tuis in te con-
citati infestique sunt.' Its prevailing meaning is ‘ hostile: but some-
