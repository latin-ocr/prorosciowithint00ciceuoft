PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξξ 15, 16.

nence. The outbreak of the Social War in Β. C. 90 had been sig-
nalised by the murder of a ‘Quintus Servilius ’ at Asculum (Liv.
Epit. 72 ; Vell. Pat. ΙΙ. 15, § 2 ; Appian‚ De Bell. Civ. I. 38).

g. Scipionibus. The name of Scipio, a patrician family of the
‘ Cornelia gens,’ is interwoven with the history of Rome. The most
recent member of it who attained distinction was L. Cornelius Scipio
Asiaticus, who was consul in Β. C. 83, along with Norbanus. He
was on the Man'an side, and was deserted and betrayed by his army
after the landing of Sulla in Italy. He was spared by Sulla (Vell.
Pat. II. 25, ξ 2 ; Liv. Epit. 853 Appian‚ De Bell. Civ. 85; Plut.
Suu. 28).

h. hospitium. Persons who were connected by the tie of ‘ hos-
pitium’ would be received, when necessary, as inmates of one an-
other’s households. This was a matter of no small importance in
the ancient world, which was not so well supplied with hotels as
the modern. ⁴ Hospitium: was regarded by the Romans as one of
the most solemn of the duties of life. There is an interesting dis-
cussion in Aulus Gellius XIV. 13, as to whether that or ‘ clientela ’
came next after one's obligations to parents and to wards. He
cites Massurius Sabinus, a writer on civil law, as giving the prefer-
ence to ‘ hospitium ' over ‘ clientela ' (‘ primum tutelae, deinde hos-
piti, deinde clienti, tum cognato, postea affini ⁹). Cornificius (Ad
H. III, ξ 4) puts the duties of life in exactly the same order—‘ hos-
pitia, clientelas, cognationes, adfinitates! The Greek for ‘ hospes'
is ξένος. Eur. Alc. 559—

αὐτός δ’ ἀρίστου τοῦδε τυγχάνω ξένου,
ὅταν ποτ’ Ἀργους διψίαν ἔλθω χθόνα.

i. familias. Used here just in the sense in which we use ‘ fami-
lies ’ or ‘ houses ' in talking of the nobility.

j. honestatis, etc. Cp. ξ) 6—‘quem honoris causa nomino.'
But the phrase here is slightly different, since ‘honestatis ampli-
tudinisque gratia' states the ground rather than the motive of the

mffgtlgrdc solum. Explained by the clause below—‘fama et vita‚'

et .
cl. domestici praedones, ‘ household brigands,' in the sense of

brigands connected with his own household. Cp. ξ 17. The ad-
jective ‘ domestici’ stands for a subjective, not for an objective
genitive.

m. possident, ‘ are in possession of.'

a. nobilitatis, ‘the nobility,’ i. e. the nobles as a class. Abstract

for concrete, as often in the case of this word.
