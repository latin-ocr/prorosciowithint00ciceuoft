PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 18, 19.

d. spero ..... esse, ‘ Ι expect there is no doubt! See ξ 6 n.

e. quod adhue est suspiriosum, ‘which is so far enough to
raise suspicion) Cp. the use of the word in ἐξ 64, 120. Cornificius
twice contrasts ‘ suspiciosus ' in the same way with ‘ perspicuus ' ’
(Ad H. II, 5 11, and IV, § 53). The first of these passages runs
thus—it is a sample of how to treat circumstantial evidence—‘ cum
, multa concurrant argumenta et signa, quae inter se consentiant, rem
perspicuam, non suspitiosam videri oportere.’

f. eulpae. This may be either the gen. or dat. Both construc-
tions are common with ‘adfinis.’ Take, for instance, De Inv. ΙΙ,
ξ 129——‘ adfinem esse alicuius culpae eum, qui accusaretur ;’ Verr.
ii. ΙΙ, 5 94—‘ rei capitalis adfinem ;’ and De Inv. II, ξ 32 ‘ nulli
minus honestae rationi adfinis;' 5 33 ‘aliis adfinem vitiis;’ ξ 34
‘nulli adfinis vitio ante admisso.' This last example shows the
meaning with the dat. to be the same as with the gen„ namely, ‘ im-
plicated in,' not merely ‘ bordering on.'

g. iudicatote. Permissive imperative. ‘ You may set down my
client as connected with the crime.’ Cp. § 57 ‘latratote;· ξ 109
‘ iudicatote.’

a. tenum, ‘ poor.’ Cp. ξ 88 and ‘tenuitas’ in § 86. In De §19.
Inv. I, ξ 35 · tenuis ⁹ is used by Cicero as the contrary of ‘ pecunio-
sus,' whereas, when he comes to the same to'pic again (ΙΙ, § 30), he
substitutes ‘ pauper.’ ⁴ Tenuis' is the opposite of the Greek παχύς.
Cp. our antithesis between ‘slender ’ and ‘ substantial!

b. libertinus. The word ‘libertinus' contemplates a freedman
in his social position; ‘ libertus ’ in his relation to his master.

c. et, nuntiat. This rhetorical repetition of a verb with ‘ et ' is
not uncommon.

d. post horam primam noctis, ‘ an hour after nightfall’ = ‘ hora
prima post noctem.’ The expression has suffered grammatical dis-
location. We may suppose ‘ post’ to have got di‘splaced and the
rest of the phrase to have been accommodated to an erroneous
notion that ‘ horam ’ ought to be governed by it. Cp. such phrases
as ‘ ante diem tertium Idus Martias,' where the ‘ ante’ really belongs
to ‘ idus: while ‘diem tertium’ stands sor ⁴ die tertio.' When the
Greeks translated these Latin phrases, they reflected the grammatical
irregularity. Thus Plutarch has πρὸ μιᾶς νωνῶν Κυντιλίων, πρὸ δυεῖν
ἡμερῶν ἢ ἐτελεύτα (Sall. 27, 37).

e. primo diluculo, ‘ at the first streak of day? Macrobius, Sat.
Ι. 3--‘ diluculum, id est, cum incipit dies dignosci.'

f. nocturnis. The Roman hours varied with the length of the
natural day and night. Hence there is a rhetorical force in ‘noc-
