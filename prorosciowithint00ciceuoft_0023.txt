foreign manners. Though Sparta preserved her laconic
brevity to the last, the art of speaking was pursued with zeal
in other parts of Greece, and famous orators arose in the
islands of the Aegean and throughout the cities of Asia.
But the Asiatic style, as it was called, was marked by a
luxuriance and meretricious ornamentation unknown to the

chastity of Attic diction ¹. This style ran into two varieties: ³

the one distinguished rather for the neatness and prettiness
of its periods, the other for its flow of highly ornamenta]

to his great rival Hortensius, whom he declares to have
been a master in both of its branches, and accounts for the
decadence of that orator in later years partly by the fact
that the style was more suitable to youth than to age 2.

Cicero in later years displays a decided aversion to the
sels-styled Atticists, who while professing to aim at simple
elegance, succeeded only in being flat and tame. It was a

this affected meagreness. His position was that a good
style was an Attic style, and that when Pericles thundered
and lightened to the Athenian populace, that was one of the
varying moods of Attic eloquence.

in the Asiatic sohool of oratory. But whatever we may
think of his native temperament and tendencies, by training

school, which was considered next in purity to the Attic ³.
The teacher to whom he confesses most obligation was
Apollonius Molo, the head of the Rhodi‘an school, who was
