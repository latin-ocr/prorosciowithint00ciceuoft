PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. §§128,129.

 

, Gall. I. 6—‘ Omnibus rebus ad profectionem comparatis diem dicunt,
Β* qua die ad ripam Rhodani omnes conveniant. Is dies erat a.d.
quintum Kal. Aprilis! Again in the sense of a period of time
‘ dies ’ is feminine, e.g. Verr. i, 5 6—‘itaque eum ego diem inqui-
rendi in Siciliam perexiguam postulavissem,’ in commenting upon
which passage Asconius points out that this sense of ‘ dies ’ gives
rise to the feminine diminutive, ‘ diecula,' whereas ‘ hodie ' (= ⁶ hoc
die’) refers to a particular day of twelve hours. The fact of Asconius
taking the trouble to point out this distinction is sufficient proof that
it was not universally observed by writers of his day. where Caesar
would say ‘ postero die,’ we find Velleius Paterculus habitually saying
‘ postera die.’ Cp. ξ 28f

c. aliquot post mensis, ‘ several months afterwards) In such
expressions of time, marking how much earlier or later one event
takes place than another, the ablative can equally be used, and is
inherently better adapted to them: so that the accusative may be
due merely to attraction to ‘ post.' Cp. 5 19 d.

d. nulla redierunt, ‘ were not returned at all.' This colloquial
use of ‘ nullus ’ occurs in the letters of Cicero, but not elsewhere in
the speecheS, unless the misericordia, quae tibi nulla debetur’ of
Cat. 1, 5 16 be considered parallel.

 

e. facet-ius, ‘more drolly.’ But it may have here the sense of
‘ finely,’ ‘ cleverly,' which is found in the eomedians.

s. ante tempus. Cp. ᾗ 127. ‘ Ante tempus’=‘ too soon} ‘post
tempus ' = ‘ too late,’ ‘ per tempus' (Ter. And. 78 3) = ‘just in time.’

g. et· prope modum, etc„ ‘ and almost wide of the mark, in that,
while I ought to be attending to the vital interests of Sextus Roscius,
I am treating him for a whitlow.’ There is the same sort of play on
the two meanings of ‘caput’ in Pro Q. ᾗ 40—‘ credamus hoc, Sex,
Naevium, cuius caput oppugnet, eius auribus pepercisse.’

Ιι. reduviam. The Scholiast tells us that this was called by the
Greeks ‘ panaricium.’ This seems to be a corruption of παρωνυχίον,
ι a diminutive from παρωνυχία, ‘ a whitlow.’

’ i. non ullius rationem, etc„ ‘ he does not take account of any
interests of his own? The form ‘ non ullius,' in place of ‘nullfus‚’
may be accounted for by the ‘ non ' preceding.

j. liberatus sit. In direct narration the words would be
‘ liberatus ero.’

a. ex animi mei sensu ae dolore, ‘ as my own feeling of indig- § 129.
nation prompts.’ The same hendiadys occurs in Verr. ii. Ι, § 69-
‘ pro suo quisque sensu ac dolore.' Cp. Verr. Div. ξ 33—-‘ animos
atque impetus!
