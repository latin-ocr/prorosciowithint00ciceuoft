PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ἓξ 40—42.

a. istum, ‘ which you ascribe to him?

b. obiecit, ‘Bsuggested Cp. Liv. v. 15—‘ profecto iratos deos
Veienti populo illo fuisse die, quo sibi eam mentem obiecissent, ut
excidium patriae fatale proderet!

c. eam quoque, i. e. the motixe sor a son being disliked by a
father.

d. illud. Referring to the more remote circumstance; ‘hoc ’
below refers to the one that has just been mentioned.

e. sine plurimis et maximis causis. See ᾗ 61 c.

f. odio fuisse parenti. Like the often-quoted line of Horace
(Carm. Ι. 28. 18):

⁶ Exitio est avidum mare nautis?

Other instances of this constr. are to be found in ξς 13, 48, 81,
84, 142. The first of the two datives is what is called in the
P. S. L. G. ‘the Predicative Dative of Purpose. '

g. necessariis, ‘cogent.’

a. Rursus. For‘ reversus, 'and therefore really pleonastic with
revertamur: but this would not be felt, any more than in our
expression ‘go back again!

b. eodem. See ξ 38.

c. is, ‘he in particular.’ The question might be taken for a
general one, if it were not thus limited by the pronoun.

d. qui odisset, ‘in that he hated.’

e. constantissimus. ‘Constantia' is one of those peculiarly
Roman ideas, like ‘ auctoritas,’ ‘ gravitas,' ‘ fides‚’ ‘industria‚’ ‘ dili-
gentia,' sor which it is difficult to find an exact equivalent in English.
‘ Consistency ’ with us is not necessarily a virtue. Mr. King trans-
lates ‘the steadiest of men.’ Its opposite is here ‘ amentia? Cp.
Cat. ΙΙ, § 2 5—‘ hinc constantia, illinc furor.’

f. profecto, ‘ indeed.’ For ‘ pro facto.'

a. relegarat. ‘ Relegare ’ is to send away with a view to getting

rid of. As a law term ‘relegatio’ means banishment without loss ’

of civil rights (‘ capitis deminutio ⁹) and not without hope of return.
It denotes therefore a milder punishment than ‘ exsilium ’ or ‘ depor-
tatio.’ See Ovid, Tristia ΙΙ. 135-7:
‘Adde‚ quod edictum, quamvis immane minaxque,
Attamen in poenae nomine lene fuit.
Quippe relegatus, non exsul, dicor in illo.'
Here the word is applied to the exercise of the ‘patria potestas‚’
as in De Off. ΙΙΙ, ᾖ 112-‘ criminabatur etiam, quod Titum filium
. . ab hominibus relegasset et ruri habitare iussisset.’ Cp. Liv.
vii. 5.
