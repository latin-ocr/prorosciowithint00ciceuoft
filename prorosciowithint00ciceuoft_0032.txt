§ 47. Τ lte Quaestio and Iudicatz’o.

When the general complexion of the case has been
determined, the orator should next fix his attention upon
what is technically known as the quaestio. This arises out
of the charge (intentio) of the accuser and the denial
(depulsio or infitiatio) of the defendant. Thus, to illustrate
by one of the stock examples‚ suppose Orestes were charged
with matricide. The fact being admitted, the intentio would
be ‘ Non iure fecisti,’ the depulsio ‘ Iure feci.’ Out of these
conflicting assertions arises the quaestio ‘Iurene fecerit?’
But the bare assertion of the defendant that his action was
justifiable of course amounts to nothing. We must suppose
therefore that it is supported by the plea that Clytaemnestra
had murdered his father—‘ Illa enim patrem meum occiderat.’
This plea is met by the demurrer that Orestes was not
the right person to execute vengeance——‘ At non abs te filio
matrem necari oportuit? Out of these counter-arguments
arises the exact question which the court has to decide,
namely, whether, in view of the fact that Clytaemnestra had
murdered the father, it was right that she should be put to
death by the son—‘ Rectumne fuerit ab Oreste matrem occidi,
curn illa Orestis patrem occidisset ? '

This more precise form of the original question is termed
the iudicatio.

The case we have taken is an instance of a constitutio
generalis. In a constitutio coniecturalis the quaestio coin-

cides with the iudicatio, since, as the fact is denied, no plea
of justification is alleged.
