II. RHETORJCAL. 31

ξ 52. The Confirmatio and Reprehensio.

The confirmatio is the establishment- of the advocate’s own
position; the reprehensio the overthrow of the adversary'S.
These two parts are the proper field of invention. In our
speech the defence against Erucius is reprehensio, while the
countercharge against the Roscii and the attack on Chryso-
gonus are confirmatio. Into the elaborate array of topics
provided for one’s aid in finding or refuting arguments, or the
proper ways of applying them to the different issueS‚ it would
be quite impossible to enter here.

ξ 53. T he Conclusio.

The conclusion, or peroration‚ consists in full of three

parts-—

(1) enumerati03

(2) indignati03

(3) conquestio.
The first of these parts is meant to resresh the memory of
the judges by a brief recapitulation of the arguments that
have been employed. The second two are an appeal to
feeling. The first part is dispensed with in the Pro Roscio,
doubtless because the charge was considered nugatory. The
second two are mingled in a masterly manner. F ifteen
topics are enumerated in the De Inventione for indignatio
and sixteen for conquestio ¹.

¹ Servius on Verg. Aen. ix. 481 cites the lament of the mother of
Euryalus as a good instance of conquestio—‘ Nam paene omnes
partes habet de misericordia commovenda a Cicerone in Rhetoricis
positas.’ Cp. De Inv. i. §5 106-109.
