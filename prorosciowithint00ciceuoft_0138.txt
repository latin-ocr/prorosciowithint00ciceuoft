ξ 60.

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ῥῷ 58-60.

b. Nihil est. Colloquial-‘ it’s no good.’ Cp. Ter. Haut. 676—
‘ quid si hoc nunc sic incipiam? nil est.'

c. non. Supply ‘ planum facis?

d. quicum=‘ cum quo.’

e. vobis, Erucius and his side generally.

f in istam fraudem, ‘ into your present predicament.’

g. mehercules. Cp. 5 141. Cicero tells us in his Orator (ξ 157)
that he prefers the form ‘mehercule ' to ‘ mehercules.'

, a. in hisee subselliis. The part of the court occupied by the

defendant’s ‘ advocati.'

b. quaesisse. Supply ‘ eum.’ It is not uncommon to find the
subject thus omitted. Take for instance Verr. Div. ξ 59—‘ nisi forte
illud, quod te dicturum esse audio, quaestorem illius fuisse‚' and again
Act. i. ξ 2 3—‘ hic alios negasse audere, alios respondisse non putare
id perfici posse.’ Cp. ᾖ 84 c.

c. ille aut ille, ‘ so and so or so and so.’ In these combinations
the pronoun is usually varied. But ep. De Inv. Ι, ξ 99—‘quid
possitis dicere, cum vobis hoc et hoc sit demonstratum ? ’

d. eausam publicam. The first extant speech of Cicero, the
Pro Quinctio, was delivered a year before this, B.C. 813 and it
appears from the opening of that oration that Cicero was already a
practised advocate. All the cases however in which he had been
engaged up to now were ‘ causae privatae,’ which touched only indi-
vidual interests. The present case was a ‘ causa publica,' because
murder was an offence against the state. It was open to anyone to
prosecute in a ‘publicum iudicium.' See Jusfinian, Inst. IV. 18, ξ 1
—-‘ Publica autem dicta sunt (i. e. iudicia), quod cuivis ex populo
exsecutio eorum plerumque datur? See also Digest 1. ¹, ἐξ 1, 2, on
the distinction between ‘ publicum ' and ⁶ privatum ius ’—-‘ Publicum
ius est quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad
singulorum utilitatem.’

e. dixerim. This is midway between ‘ dixissem’ and ‘dixiff
‘ Dixissem⁷ would be purely subjective, representing only what
Erucius thought ; ‘ dixi ' would be purely objective, stating a down·
right fact. ‘ Dixerim ' subscribes the assent of the speaker to what
the person spoken of thought.

s. vestro consessu, etc. By this touch Cicero seeks to inflame
the sels-love alike of the judges and of the audience against
Erucius.

a. Usque eo . . . ante quam. A mixture of two constructions‚

(1) ‘ usque eo eum iocari, durn; '
(2) ‘ antea eum iocari, quam?
