4 PREFA CE.

have to thank Mr. J. B. Bury, the talented author of the
Hz'stoty os the Later Roman Empz‘re, for the pains which
he bestowed upon the revision of my manuscript in this
initial stage of its existence. I am sensible also of how
much benefit my notes have derived from being submitted
to the criticisrn of Mr. Evelyn Abbott.

But while thankful for the help that I have received, Ι
cannot close this preface without expressing a regret‚
however vain, for the help that has been denied me. Myv
old friend and schoolfellow‚ Robert Lowes Clarke, late
Fellow and Librarian of Queen’s CoHege, had promised
to perform for my work on Cicero, as he did for my work
on Plato, the same kindly office that Socrates performed
for Theaetetus. Those who knew him will be well aware
how much this meant. It meant not only knowledge
practically inexhaustible‚ but an unstinted generosity in
laying that knowledge at the service of others. For
great as were his intellectual attainments, it is not by
these that he will be most vividly remembered. The
truest tribute that can be paid him is to say that he was
kind and helpful to every creature that ever sought his
aid. To-record that he was unselfish would be too little ;
rather be it said that he knew not self.
