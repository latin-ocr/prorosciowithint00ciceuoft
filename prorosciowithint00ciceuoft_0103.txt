PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧ 6.

h. invaserit. The subjunctive here is due to the oblique narra·
tion. By the use of it Cicero fastens an imputation of effrontery
upon Chrysogonus. ‘ Quoniam ’ in itself takes the indicative.
‘ Invadere ’ was technically used of the seizure of landed property
as opposed to moveables or cattle. Justinian, Inst. IV. Tit. ΙΙ, ξ 1
—‘ in invasionibus quae circa res soli fiunt.'

i. suspitionem. The long i is probably due to contractiori
from ‘suspicitio.’ Cp. ‘ stipendium ' = ‘stipipendium.’

j. sese. Subj. to posse. For the sake of emphasis it is intro-
duced before arbitratur, on which it depends.

k. hoo . . . hujus. The repetition of ‘ huius ' after ‘hoc’ is like
the perpetual ‘my elient' and ‘my client's' in the mouth of a
modern barrister. It is not usual to have an abl. abs. referring to
a noun otherwise mentioned in the sentence. Yet Caesar (Bell.
Gall. II. 22) has—‘cum diversis legionibus aliae alia in parte
hostibus resisterent,’ where the nom. ‘ diversae legiones' might have
been used. Here we should doubtless have had ‘huius incolumis,’
were it not for the balance of the other abl. abs. ‘ damnato et eiecto'
in the succeeding clause.

l. obtinere. Cp. ξ 139. ·' Obtinere’ in Latin means ‘to keep’
as well as ‘to get.' Our word ‘obtain‚' so far as it is transitive,
has perpetuated only the latter meaning. In the case of ‘ occupare '
and ‘occupy’ the converse change has come about. The Latin
word means ‘ to take possession of‚' the English rather ‘to be in
possession of.’

m. eiecto, ⁶ expelled,’ i. e. from the state, on the assumption that
he would not await his sentence. See Cat. ΙΙΙ, ξ 3—‘ Nam tum
curn ex urbe Catilinam eiciebam—non enim iam vereor huius
verbi invidiam ;’ and cp. Verr. ii. 1‚§ 98 ad fin.—‘ condemnato et
eiecto.'

n. se posse. Here we have the pres. infin. after ‘sperat,’ in
apparent violation of the rule that verbs os hoping take the fut.
infin. Cp. Pro Mil. 5 32—‘ speraret posse se eludere,' and Verg.
Aen. IV. 305—

‘ Dissimulare etiam sperasti, perfide, tantum
posse nefas? ’

If the use were confined to ¹ posse,' We might explain it by the fact
that that verb happens to have no fut. inf. But see ξ 18—‘spero
ex hoc ipso non esse obscurum ;’ and cp. Ad H. ΙΙ, ξ 28-‘ sperabat
illius morte se salutem sibi comparare.‘ In all these cases we
may translate ‘sperare' by ‘expect,' and regard it as a verb of
thinking.
