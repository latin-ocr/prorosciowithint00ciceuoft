PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. 55143—146.

a. haee omnis oratio, ‘all that Ι have just said ⁹—fr0m 5 130 ξ 143, ·

onwards.

b. iam ante. See 5 129.

c. imperitus morum, ‘ignorant of the world.’

d. iure gentium, ‘ the principles ofjustice‚’ common to all mankind.

a. in suam rem convertit, ⁴ turned to his own use‚' ‘ embezzled.' ξ 144.
Cp. 5 114—‘in suam rem convertisset.' The irony and pathos of
this whole passage are remarkable.

b. anulumque. What Juvenal (Sat. XI. 43) says of spendthrifts
would hold true of any Roman—-

‘a dominis post cuncta novissimus exit
anulus!

c. excepit=‘ reservavit ' in 5 146.

a. misericordia, ‘ chafity: ξ 145.

b. Mea. See 5 32 c.

c. hominem occidere. ‘Hominem’ is often used for ‘ eum’:

 

but here the two words ‘ hominem occidere ’ make up the one idea
of ‘ murder? Cp. 5 80 ‘ homines occiderentur,' ‘ murders were being
committed’3 5 100 ‘modum hominis occidendi,’ ‘ method of murder’;
ἓ 128 ⁴ homo occisus est,’ ‘the murder took place.’

d. ab eone. ‘ Ab’ is not strong enough to bear the weight of the
interrogative. Cp. 5 1 14 b.

e. praeter ceteros tu, ‘you have no special cause to sear,' as
being Sulla’s favourite.

fl vereri . . . metuere. Notice the change from ‘ vereri ' to
‘ metuere.’ It is merely to avoid monotony. When the two words
are distinguished (as in Pro Q. 5 1), ‘ vereri’ signifies a reverential,
‘ metuere,' a more craven sear. See De Sen. 5 37--6 metuebant
servi, verebantur liberi.' Cicero mentions it as a recognised subject
of inquiry whether there were any differenee between the two words.
De Orat. III, 5 117.

g. debeas. The subjunctive isto be accounted for as coming
under the government of ‘ ostendis? But the indicative would seem
more natural, as representing a remark thrown in on the part of
Cicero himself.

 

h. ne quando. The shorter forms of the relative pronouns and
particles are used after ‘ne.’ Thus we have ‘ne quis,' not ‘ne
aliquis} ‘ necubi’ (=‘ ne cubi ')‚ not ‘ ne alicubi,' and so on.

a. emptionis tuae, ‘ of the security 'of your purchase! Cicero ξ 146,
seems to forget that he had denied that there was any purchase at

all (5127).

b. in eis rebus, etc„ ‘ than on the achievements os L. Sulla.'
