PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 37, 38.

of the pl. when we begin to elassify attributes and arrange them into ,
genera and species.

c. complexa. Notice that the deponent participle is here used in
a passive sense.

d. esse videantur. Generic use of the subjunctive. Cicero's
fondness for the ending ‘esse videatur' was noticed by the ancient
critics, who complain of its imitation by subsequent writers. Quin-
tilian (x, 2, § 18) says—‘ Otiosi et supini, si quid modo longius
circumduxerunt, iurant ita Ciceronem locuturum fuisse. Noveram
quosdam, qui se pulchre expressisse genus illud coelestis huius in
dicendo viri sibi viderentur, si in clausula posuissent “esse videa-
tur.’‘' To the same effect is Tacitus, Dial. 23.

e. voltu saepe laeditur pietas, ‘filial respect is often violated
by a look.' ‘ Pietas ’ is thus defined in the De Inventione (ΙΙ, ξ 66;
cp. ξ 161)—‘ quae erga patriam aut parentes aut alios sanguine con-
iunctos officium conservare moneat.’

s. in eum, qui mortem obtulerit. The subj. imparts a generic
force to the ‘eum.’ So below, ‘eius, qui in crimen vocetur.’ For
the phrase ‘ mortem offerre alicui' cp. ξ 40, and Pro Sest. § 48 ad
fin.——‘ mortem saepe hostibus obtulisset.’

g. cogebant. We may turn this by ‘ he was bound.'

a. portenti . . . simile. The gen. after ‘similis' is said to- be
specially used of a moral resemblance.

b. in crimen vocetur. For the phrase cp. ᾗ 113 ‘in crimen
iudiciumque vocatur. ’

c. immanem, ‘brutish.’ Cp. ἐξ 63, 71, 146, 150, in ’³⁴11 Which
passages the word is coupled either with ‘ bestia ' or ‘ fera.’

α’. omnia ad perniciem, etc. Mr. King vigorously renders this,
‘the whole character shattered and blasted in utter ruin.’ The
metaphor, if there is one intended, is from the defeat of an army.
The strict meaning of the word ‘ profligare ’ is ‘ to break the neck
of a thing'3 it is used of giving all but the final blow to an enemy.
See this meaning brought out in Liv. xxi. 40, ἓ 11—‘ Sed ita forsitan
decuit, cum foederum ruptore duce ac populo deos ipsos sine ulla
humana ope committere ac profligare bellum, nos, qui secundum
deos violati sumus, commissum ac profligatum conficere.’ So also
by Augustus on the monumentum Ancyranum—‘ coepta profligataque
opera a patre meo perfeci.’ These and many other passages show
that Aulus Gellius (xv, 5) is wrong in objecting to the use current
in his own day of the phrase ‘in profligato esse ’ of a thing that is
almost finished. Cicero, however, often uses ‘ profligatus ' ‘in a
rough sense as a synonym for ‘perditus,' as here and in Verr. i,
