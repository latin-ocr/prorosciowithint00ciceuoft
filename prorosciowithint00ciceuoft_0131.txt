PRO SEX. ROSCIO. No‘TES. ᾧῷ 46, 47.

is inclined to assign him the palm for comedy (De Opt. Gen. Or. ξ 2).
Volcatius Sedigitus (Aul. Gell. xv. 24) peremptorily settles the
question—-

’ ‘Caecilio palmam Statio do comico,

Plautus secundus facile exsuperat ceteros?

e. Eutychus. Greek Εὔτυχος, instead of the more usual Εὖτυχής.
The same form occurs in the Acts of the Apostles, xx, 9.

f. Chaerestratus, A play o‘f Caecilius is quoted by Festus
(p. 174) under the title of Hypobolimaeus Chaerestratus. It may be
the one that Cicero has in view. There was a play of· Meander
called the Hypobolimaeus or the ‘ Supposititious Son.’ Quint. Ι. 10,
ξ 18.

g. hoc nomine. Descriptive ablative.

a.. ne longius abeam, ‘ without going further afield.' · ξ 47 ,

b. tribulis, ‘fellow-townsmen,' like ‘civis’ for ‘concivis.’ Cp.
the use of ‘ municeps ’ in §§ 87, 105. Cicero, as a native of Arpinum,
would belong to the ‘tribus Comelia.' See Liv. XXXVIII. 36—
‘Rogatio perlata est, ut in Aemilia tribu Formiani et Fundani, in
Cornelia Arpinates ferrent.'

c. agricolas adsiduoS, ‘ attentive to their farms.' Cp. 5 67 d.

d. eum et. Three coordinate clauses follow on ‘ cum‚' each
introduced by ‘et.' The first explains ‘odiosum’3 the other two
refer to the sense rather than the words of the principa] clause, as
though Cicero had said ‘ Ι will not mention names.’

e. vobis. Referring to the audience generally.

· f. magis notus. For the form of the comparative cp. ‘magis
occulta' Verr. Div. ᾗ 33. When a participle comes into common
use, itis treated as an adjective and compared. This is the case even
with a pres. participle, e. g. ‘amans‚’ ‘amantior,’ ‘amantissimus' ;
‘ egen5,' ‘ egenti0r‚’ ‘ egentissimus.’ ’ ’

g. comicum, ‘in the comedy.’ So Caecilius in his Epicler1153 as
quoted by Cicero De Amic. § 99 ; cp. De Sen. ξ 36—-

‘Ut me hodie ante omnis comicos stultos senes
versaris atque inluseris lautissime.’
‘ Tragicus ¹ is used in the same way in Hor. De Arte Poet. 95.

lz. ut effictos, etc., ‘that we might see our manners portrayed in
the persons of others and a lively image of our daily life? ‘ Expressus '
is a metaphor from a work in high relies, like the ‘stantem extra
pocula caprum ' of Juv. I. 76. With the use os it here we may com-
pare Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ξ 20 ad iim—‘persona illa’ (i. e. ‘ Ballionis‚'
a pander in the Pseudolus of Plautus) ‘ lutulenta, impura, invisa in
istius moribus, natura vitaque est expressa ' (wrought to the life).
