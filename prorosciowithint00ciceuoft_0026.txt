22 INTRODUCTJON.

be superseded by the De Oratore and the rest of his orato-
rical works1. Nevertheless the treatise has an interest to
us, independently of its own merits, though these are more
than the author will admit. For it lets us into the secret of
the elaborate method, whereby the most consummate master .
of rhetoric that the world has ever seen was first trained in
the technicalities of his art.

ξ 37. The Ad Herennium.

Closely connected with the De Inventione is the work'
which goes under the 'name of Rhetoricorum ad C. Heren-
nium. So close indeed is the connexion between the two
as to excuse the assumption of the great scholars of the
Renaissance, who ascribed this treatise also to Cicero. The
relation of the one to the other is an interesting literary
problem. They have whole passages in common, exampleS,
allusions, quotations, and even mistakes, excluding all pos-
sibility of coincidence3 and yet they diverge from one
another on vital points of treatment. The Ad Herennium
covers, concisely but completely, the whole field of rhetoric;
the De Inventione, as we have seen, is only a fragment, but
a fragment of a treatise on a much larger scale. The author
of the former poses as a Roman gentleman who consents to
gratify a friend by writing in a practical spirit on rhetoric,
notwithstanding that he is occupied with family affairs, and
would rather devote such leisure as he has to the serious
things of philosophy ². He confesses himself to be deficient

(i. e. lectures entered in his boyish note· books), et si qua est in his
culpa tradentis est.’

¹ The Ancients distinguished between the De Inventione and the
later writings of Cicero on cognate subjects by calling the former
the ‘rhetorical’ and the latter ‘che‘ oratorical’ works. See Quint.

he refers to the ‘rhetorici‘ of Cicero, is quoting from the De In-
ventione.
