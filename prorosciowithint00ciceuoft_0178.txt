PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. §§140-142.

more intelligible when we remember that the Roman roads were
raised like some of our railroads. Verg. Aen. V. 273 τ
‘ qualis saepe viae deprensus in aggere serpens.’

g. iter adfectet. Cp. Verg. Geor. IV. 562——‘ viamque adfectat
Olympo.’ The phrase occurs also in the comedians, e. g. Ter.
Phorm. 964-—

‘hi gladiatorio animo ad me adfectant viam.’

lz, sincerum sanctumque, ‘pure and undefiled.’ Cp. Pro Q.
ς 5—‘ profecto nihil est iam sanctum atque sincerum in civitate.’

ξ 141, a. Hicine. For the ‘i' in this word cp. such locative forms as
‘ domi‚' ‘ ruri‚' ‘Tiburi,' etc.

b. hoe . . . quod, ‘ on this account, because.’ ‘ Hoc’ is abl.
indigne fero is here used absolutely—‘ I am indignant.’

c. quod verear. The reason is given as it appeals (or rather as
it does not appeal) to Cicero’s mind. We have therefore the sub-
jective mood, commonly called the subjunctive.

d. speravit, . . . posse. See ξ 6 n.

e. exspectata. Dun'ng the four years that Sulla was absent from
Italy.

fl ad libidinem suam. See ξ 54 h.

g. servolique nobilium, ‘ nobilium,’ goes with ‘liberti servoli-
que ’ ; ‘ bona ' belongs to ‘ nostras.'

ξ 142, a. Si id aetum est, ‘if that was what was aimed at.' Cp. ξ 8
‘ sin aliud agitur nihil!

b. hoo. Referring to ‘ ut ad libidinem,' etc.

c. tametsi . . . sensi, ‘though Ι confined myself to feeling,
judges‚ and did not fight! During the Marsic or Social War in
B. C. 89, Cicero served under the consul Cneius Pompeius Strabo,
the father of Pompeius Magnus ε but he took refuge from the civil
commotioris which followed in the study of literature and philosophy
(Phil. XII. 5 27, · Plut. Cic. 3).

d. ornamento. ,rei publicae. See 5 40 f

e. tum vero. Cp. ξ 137—‘ tum vero in isto bello?

f. optimo et nobilissimo cuique, ‘all the best and noblest. ’
So below‘ nequissimo cuique?

g. rationem communicatam. The vague word‘ rationem,'
which we may render ‘interests ’ is here substituted for ‘ causam ’
(cp. ξ 140 ‘ suam causam cnm Chrysogono communicare ’) , because
of the use of ‘ causae ’ below. At the same time it may be meant to
convey a reference to the accounts of partners.

h. ab hoe splendore causae, ‘from a cause of so much
lustre.'
