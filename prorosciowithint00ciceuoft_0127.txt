PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ἕξ 38, 39.

§8—‘ usque eo senatoria iudicia perdita profligataque esse arbi-
tratur?

e. obiciendi, ‘of damaging his character,’ i.e. without attempting
to substantiate the charge. ‘

f. nequam. Indeclinable adjective. 'It is supposed to be a relic
osa phrase ‘ ne quam frugem habet‚’ indicating that a person was
good sor nothing. This word, therefore, with its opposite ‘frugi,'
carries us back to the early rural life of Italy.

a. Annos natus maior quadraginta. The construction is on §39.
the lines of ‘ annos natus quadraginta ’ ; ‘ maior ' does not affect it.
Adverbs of quantity are similarly interpolated.· Cp. Pro Q. ξ 41—
‘ At tecum plus annum vixit ’ ; Verr. ii. I, ξ 14--‘ cum (eum) Syra-
cusis amplius centum cives Romani cognoscerent? The same sort
of construction is found in Greek, e. g. Xen. Anab. vi. 4 (2), ξ 24-
ἀποκτείνουσι τῶν ἀνδρῶν οὐ μεῖον πεντακοσίους. Sometimes ‘quam ’
is used after ‘ maior,’ as in Livy xlv. 32-—‘ cum liberis maioribus
quam quindecim annos natis.’ This implies a nom. sing. ‘maior

’ quam quindecim annos natus,’ and ‘maior natus’ as a whole is

turned into the abl. pl. to agree with ‘liberis.’ A simplet form
occurs in ξ 100 ‘ minorem annis lx.’
b. ne dici quidem, ‘even alleged‚' i.e. without attempt at

.. proof.

 

c. Luxuries. Immediately below we have the abl. of the 1st decl.
So again in § 75 the nom. is used according to the 5th and the abl.
according to the 1st declension. Cp. the variety of form in
‘ materies,’ ‘ tristities.' ⁸

d. purgavit. It would be too much to say that this governs
‘hunc ’; but the proximity of that pronoun renders the omission of
the object easier here.

e. in convivio. For this charge cp. ξ 52. The dat. is the pre-
vailing constr. with ‘ interesse?

f. cupiditates. A general word for ‘ passions.’ De InV. Ι, '
§ 33—‘ genus est omnium nimirum libidinum cupiditas!

g. habitarit . . . vixerit, ‘ dwelt in the country and spent his life
in sarming.' There is a tendency in English to confound these two
different ideas, which relate severally to space and time, under the
one verb ‘to live.’ With ‘habitare' and ‘vivere' compare Germ.
‘ wohnen ' and ‘ leben,¹ F rench ‘ dementer ' and ‘ vivre.'

h. quae vita. Referring to the cogn. acc. latent in ‘vixerit.'

τ’. maxime disiuncta a cupiditate. In Verr. ii. ΙΙ, ξ 149, Cicero
speaks of sarmers as ‘is ordo atque id hominum genus, quod optimum
atque honestissimum est.’
