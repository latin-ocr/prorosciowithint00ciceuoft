PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξξ 76—78.

fecisti?’ ‘ Tute ' is an old and strong form of the 2nd personal
pronoun‚ with corresponding acc. ‘tete,' e. g. Catull. Carm. C. 5—
*‘ quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum.'

e. suspitiose. Cp. ᾗ 55 ‘criminose ac suspitiose.’

f. Nuntium. Doubtless here ‘ messenger,’ not ‘ message,’ but the
word is quite ambiguous.

a. rem miseram et calamitosam, etc. Explained by the words ξ 77.
‘quod non licet id facere quod in tali crimine innocenti saluti solet
esse.’ The usual inversion of the relative and its antecedent has
taken place with regard to the second ‘quod‚' and the syntax is
further complicated by the addition of an ‘ ut ’ clause, explanatory of
‘ id quod innocenti saluti solet esse.’

b. in quaestionem, ‘to be put on the rack.' ‘ “ Quaestionem''
intellegere debemus tormenta et corporis dolorem ad eruendam
veritatem.' Ulpian (Dig. XLVII. 10, ἐξ 15, 41). Although slaves
could not be examined against their master (ξ 120) without his
consent, it was competent to the master himself to offer them for
examination.

c. unus puer . . . relictus non est. Instead of the more usual
‘ ne unus quidem.’ Cp. De Prov. Cons. § 7-—‘ unum signum Byzantii
ex maximo numero nullum haberent.'

d. P. Scipio. . . Metelle. Cp. ξ 15. Nothing is known for
certain of either of these persons. But the P. Scipio spoken of
may possibly have been Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, praetor
in B.C. 94, and grandson of the Nasica who slew Tiberius Gracchus.
As for Metellus, the omission of the letter indicating the praenomen
baffles all attempts at identification.

e. advocatis . . . agentibus. Referring to proceedings before
the trial, when the ‘advocati’ of the accused brought a formal
demand that the evidence of the slaves should be taken. Had the

. examination actually been held, it would have been the business of

 

the ‘ advocati ' to be present at it. See Pro Clu. ἐξ 176, 177.

fl servos paternos. On this subject cp. ἐξ 119, 120.

g. ¹1¹. Roscium. Magnus. See ξ 119. The demand would be
addressed to him as procurator of Chrysogonus (ᾖ 23).

h. sectantur. A frequentative from ‘ sequor '—‘ they are in the
train of.’ Cp. the use of ‘sectatores’

τ’. ego postulo, etc.‚ ‘ I demand as a right, my client begs and
implores.' ‘ Postulo ’ =cifcc5w.

a. fugitant, ‘shirk'——a vulgar word, said to occur only here in ξ '7 8.
Cicero.

b. mortis paternae. Doubtless we should have had ‘ de morte
