 

PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧ 23.

c. procurator Chrysogoni. Cp. ξ 21 ‘nomine Chrysogoni.'
A ‘procurator ' was an agent or attorney, who was empowered to
act for another. Digest ΙΙΙ. 3, ξ 1———‘ Procurator est qui aliena ne—
gotia mandatu domini administrat.'

d. funeri. It is possible that ‘ funus ’ here may have its poetical
sense of‘ ‘ corpse.’

e. iusta. Servius (on Aen. V. 64) tells us that among the
ancient Romans the corpse was kept for seven days, bumt on the
8th, and buried on the 9th. He quotes Horace, Epod. XVII.
4 ‘Novemdiales dissipare pulvereS‚’
which means ashes that have just been buried.

f. solvisset. The usual phrase is ‘iusta facere.' The force of
the subj. is ‘ though he had not yet paid.'

g. eicit. Cp. ξ 71 ‘obicere, deicere3' ξ 72 ‘eiciuntur;' §81
‘ obicient3’ ξ 153 ‘reicitis' ‘ Ι- consonans is omitted before i by
the compounds of “ iacio,'’ “ ab-icio,'' “con-ici0‚’' “ pro-icio,'’
“re-ici0,'’ etc.; though the long quantity of the first syllable is
kept; i being=ji.' (P. S. L. G. ξ 12, viii. 1, 4.)

k. atque focis, etc. ‘Atque' couples the two verbs ‘eicit‘ and
‘ exturbat.’

τ’. praeeipitem. Cp. Pro Q. ξ) 83—‘ at hic quidem, iam de fundo
expulsus, iam a suis dis penatibus praeceps eiectus.’

j. pecuniae. See ξ 6 g.

k. dominus, ‘ owner; ' used equally in relation to land, money,
and slaves. ‘

l. qui ..... fuisset, ‘ as he had been.’ The subj. gives a reason
for the extravagance of his subsequent behaviour.

m. egentissimus. Landgraf registers the observation that
‘ pauper ’ occurs only three times in the whole of Cicero's speecheS‚
and ‘paupertas’ only once. They are not strong enough for his
rhetorical diction. A ‘ pauper ’ among the Romans might be inde-
pendent and respectable. Cp. Hor. Epist. II. 2, 12—‘ meo sum
pauper in aere.’ A passage in the Paradoxa (VI, 545) shows
‘paupertas ' to be a weak word—‘ itaque istam paupertatem vel
potius egestatem ac mendicitatem tuam nunquam obscure tulisti?

n. ut, fit. These words show us that the experience of the
Romans was in keeping with our own—‘ Set a beggar on horse·
back, and he'll ride to the devil.' The character of the ‘nouveau
riche ’ was ridiculed on the Roman stage. See what Cicero says of
Antony (Phil. II, ξ 6 5)—-—‘ exsultabat gaudio persona de mimo, modo
egens, repente dives?
