equivalent to the later term ‘mandator' or ‘ qui mandatum recipit ’
to ‘ mandatarius!

j. gesta atque commissa. This looks like putting the cart be-
fore the horse : but ‘ gesta ’ may refer to the proceedings on the part

,οἱ the town council preliminary to the trust.

k. caerimoniam, ‘ the sacred character)

l. tandem, ‘pray?' See ς 33 g.

a. transigeret atque decideret, ⁶ arrange and compound.' We
may supply ‘hanc rem‚’ but it is not necessary. Cp. Verr. ii. II,
ξ 79 ‘qui cum reo transigat, post cum accusatore decidat.' There
appears to be no difference of meaning between the two words. In
their technical sense both are used of a voluntary arrangement be-
tween litigants made by the friends of the contending parties and in
presence of a ‘iudex.’ See Pro Q. ξ 20. The abstract term ‘ de-
cisio ' is also found in Cicero, e. g. Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ᾗ 33 ad in.

b. inque eam rem. An instance against the rule of classical
Latinity prior to Livy, that ‘ que’ can only follow a preposition
when the same preposition has preceded. Caesar offends against
it too (Bell. Gall. V. 36)-ζ inque eam rem se suam fidem inter-

onere.’
p c. suam. Referring back to Sextus Roscius. ‘Capito' must be
understood as subject to ‘ interponeret.’ The meaning is that Capito
was to be empowered to pledge the honour of Sextus.

cedere.’

e. nonne . . . damnatus, etc„ ‘ would he not be condemned by
an umpire and not only make restitution, but lose all his honour? ’
The ‘ arbiter ' decided according to equity, the ‘ iudex ' according to
law.

a. Nunc, ‘as a matter of fact.' Cp. ξ 148 ‘nunc' ita defen-
ditur.’ ’

b. decurionibus. See 5 25 a.

c. paulum nescio quid, ‘some 'trifle,' literally ‘ a small some-
thing.' ‘ Paulum ' is an adj. agreeing with the subst. ‘nescio

uid?
q d. funditus, ‘ utterly? Literally, ‘ from the bottom ’ (‘ fundus ').
The termination ‘ -itus‘ denotes motion or direction from, and cor-
responds to the Greek -θε 01· -θεν, Cp. οὐρανόθεν, θεόθεν, ῥιζόθεν with
‘ caelitus: ‘ divinitus,’ ‘ radicitus‚' ‘ stirpitus?
e. tantidem . . . suam, ‘ of as much account as his own honour,'
