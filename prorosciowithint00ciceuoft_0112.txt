PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ξς 17, 18.

Landgraf calls attention to the fact that the descriptive genitive
in Latin takes the place of a compound adjective in Greek—‘ pluri-
marum ρειΙιῐιειωω-τπολυστεφής. The words refer to Capito. For
this sarcastic use of ‘ palma,’ cp. ἐξ 84, 100.

f. vetus. Implying that he was an old hand at murder. The
diminutive is used in a slightly jocular sense in Pro Q. ξ 29—
⁸ Alfenus interea Romae cum isto gladiatore vetulo quotidie pug-
nabat.’ Cp. 5 28 c.

g. nobilis, ⁶ well-known,’ ‘ famous‚’ It is a term specially used
of gladiators and public performers generally. In Pro Q. §69
Cicero plays on the double meaning of the word ‘nobilis.’ He is
twitting Sextus Naevius with political inconsistency, and hints that
he had been such a violent democrat that he could not stomach
even a gladiator who was ‘ nobilis '—‘ erat enim, inquit, illarum
partium. quidni? qui apud te esset eductus ; quem tu a puero
sic instituisseS, ut nobili ne gladiatori quidem faveret-⁹

lz. hio autem. N otice the employment of '‘hic,’ instead of the
usual ⁴ iste‚’ because Magnus, who is present in court, is contrasted
with the absent Capito. Cp. Verr. i. § 9, where ‘hic‘ is used of
Verres just where he is being contrasted with a person out of court,
while in the next sentence Cicero returns to the usual ⁶ iste.’

z'. ad eum lanistam. Cp. ξ 102 ‘magistrum suum‚’ and ξ 1 18
‘ille lanista.'

j. quique ..... esset, ‘ and though he might have been a tiro
before this conflict.'

k. quod seiam, ‘ for aught 1 know.' The words leave it open to
the hearers to imagine any previous villainies they please. For the
subjunctive, cp. ξ 95 ‘ quod salva fide possim!

l. ipsum magistrum. Landgraf refers us to Cic. Ep. Fam. IX.
7, ξ 2, where Cicero quotes a Greek iambie line—

πολλοὶ μαθηταὶ κρείσσονες διδασκάλων.

, α. Nam cum hie, etc. It was not pretended by the accusers that

the younger Sextus Roscius had murdered his father with his own
hand (see ξ 79 ad fin.)‚ so that Cicero is not required to establish
an ‘alibi.' Very likely he could not have proved his assertion that
Magnus was at Rome at the time of the murder ; and so the positive
statement with which he commences is whittled down in the next
pair of clauses into a mere presumption.

b. adsiduus, See ξ 67 d.

c. Palaeinas. Cp. ‘ in vico Pallacine ’ in the fragmentary pas-
sage, § 13²· The ‘ balneae Palaeinae' are placed by antiquaries
near the Circus Flaminius.
