PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. .§§ 6, 7.

0. adeptus est( The indic„ because put as a statement of fact,
not as part of what Chrysogonus thought.

p. scrupulum. The metaphor is from taking a pebble out of
one's shoe. ‘A thorn in one’s side’ is the nearest English equiva-
lent. Cp. Ter. Andr. 940—-

‘ At mi unus scrupulus etiam restat, qui me male habet.’

q. se. Referring to the subject of the main verb ‘postulat,‘
under the influence of the ‘ sibi ’ preceding. We might have ex·
pected either ‘eum’ with the indic„ or ‘ se ’ with the subi„ according
as the statement is made by the writer or thrown into the mind
of the person of whom he is speaking.

r. dies noctisque. See 81 a.

s. ut . . . ut. The first ‘ ut ' denotes the thing requested‚ the
second the object of the request, ‘to the end that! It would be
possible to take the second ‘ut ' in the same sense as the first, as
depending immediately upon ‘postulat '—‘ he asks you to profess?
In that case we would have a rhetorical asyndeton.

, a. peto ut . . . ne. Notice how ‘ peto' is followed both by an

affirmative and negative clause. The same combination of ‘ nt '
and ‘ ne’ recurs in almost the same context in ξ 150 ad in.

b. fortunisque. The pl. is common in the sense of our
word ‘fortune ’=wealth. Cp. ἐξ 5, 13, 57 ad fin„ 113 ad in.‚
144.

c. nostris. The sympathy of the advocate leads him to couple
and sometimes to identify himself with his client, so that we have
the first person pL, as here and in ξ 150, or the first sing, as in
ἐξ 32» 94, ¹45·

d. sanguinem et vitam, ‘ ourlife·blood.' There is no particular
force in the position of the wordS‚ as though ‘ vitam’ were stronger
than ‘ sanguinem.’ In Pro Q. ᾗ 76 they occur in reverse order—-
‘ fateatur se non pecuniam, sed vitam et sanguinem petere‚’ while in
ξ 39 of the same speech it is ‘ sanguinem vitamque.'

e. et . . . propulsatis. It is unusual to have the third clause
coupled by ‘et‚’ where no ‘ et’ has preceded. Here the first two
clauses represent two different sides of the same fact.

f. quod in omnis intenditur. In the exordium of a speech
one of the main objects of the orator is to rivet the attention of his
hearers. There is no more effectual way of accomplishing this end
than by showing that their own interests are involved in the case.
See the precepts given in De Inventione 1, § 2 3—‘ attentos autem
faciemus, si demonstrabimus ea, quae dicturi erimus, magna, nova,
incredibilia esse et aut ad omnis aut ad eos, qui audient, aut ad

ἓ
