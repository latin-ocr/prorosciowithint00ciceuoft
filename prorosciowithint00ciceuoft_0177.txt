PRO SEX. ROSCIO· NOTES. §§138-140.

d. decrevissem. As senator. The usual term is· ‘ censere‘ for
the opinion of the individual member; but cp. Pro Mil. ξ 14.

e. recte et ordine. Pro Q. ξ 28—‘ recte atque ordine factum
videtur?

. a. Dum necesse erat. See 5 91 α. § 139. Ι

b. omnia poterat. Cognate accusative. Cp. ς 141 ‘ aliquid
posse‚' § 149 ‘ quantum possent.’

c. procuratio, ‘administration.’ Cp. Verr. ii. 1, ξ 99—‘quae-
storiaeque tuae procurationis?

d. retinere . . . obtinere. ‘ Obtinere’ is here ‘to make good
their claim to.' There is the same play on the two words in
Pro Q. 5 7 5-—‘ si veritatem volent retinere, gravitatem possint ob-
tinere?

e. nolo . . . dicere. Aposiopesis, ‘ but I will not say anything
severe against them, if only to avoid the ill omen.' ‘ Vel ominis
causa,' is what the sense requires. The ‘ ne . . . quidem ' merely
carries out the previous negative in ‘ nolo.’

s. nostri isti nobiles. This combination of two pronouns of
different persons exactly expresses Cicero's position on the outside
edge of the aristocratical party. He puts in a claim to belong to
them in spirit, and yet in the same breath speaks of them as foreign
to himself.

g. ornamenta, ‘ distinctions,' with special reference to the
‘iudicia.'

lz. concedant necesse est. This prophecy was fulfilled by the
lex Aurelia, in B. c. 70.

a. male, ‘treasonably.' ξ 140.

b. si qui. See ξ 111 a.

c. equestrem splendorem. See ξ 20 g. We may call to mind at
this point that Cicero himself was of equestrian origin, and had not
as yet risen out of his own class. In Verr. i, ξ 38, he claims for the
knights that during the fifty years (roughly speaking) for which they
exercised the ⁴ iudicia’ there had not been the slightest suspicion of a
bribed verdict.

d. servi. A rhetorical exaggeration for ‘liberti.’ Cp. ξ 141-—‘ li-
berti servolique nobilium.'

e. quarn viam, etc. The words ‘ quam viam munitet, quod iter
adfectet,' may be a quotation from a play, or the latter of the two
clauses may be a gloss upon the former, which has crept into the
text.

fl munitet. This seems to be the only passage in which the
frequentative form occurS. The phrase ‘ munire viam’ becomes
