they chose was an effective one, for the orator in question was
consumed with a thirst for glory, which prompted him on
occasions to a splendid heroism, though he was naturally of ·
a timid disposition.

ξ 24. His previous traz‘nz'ng.

Cicero was now in his 27th year ¹. Prior to Sulla’s dictator-
ship he had not practised in the law-courts : for indeed there
were no law-courts to practise in 2. But his spare figure
might have been seen daily in the Forum with long thin neck
outstretched, eager to catch the tones of the popular orators
as they thundered from the rostra ³. And all the time he had
been assiduously practising rhetoric, chiefly under Greek
masterS, and studying philosophy, logie, and civil law, so that
when the courts had been re-established, and he at length
appeared in the Forum in his 26th year (Rc. 81), it was not

¹ Aulus Gellius, N.A. xvq 28, says loosely ‘annos iam septem
atque viginti natus,’ adding however at the end of the same chapter
the correct expression ‘septimoque et vicesimo pro Q. Roscio.'
Quintilian, xii. 6, §4‚ says more accurately ⁴ sex et viginti annos
natus.' The date of Cicero's birth was ‘a.d. Nonas Januarias‚
Q. Caepione, Q. Serrano consulibus ’ (Jan. 3, B. C. 106). I’ompey was
born towards the close os the same year.
