38 PRO SEX. ROSCIO. ξς» 14, 15.

T hat you may know how black the case is, I will give you a detailed
account of it.

Atque ut facilius intellegere possitis, iudiceS, ea, quae 14
facta sunt, indigniora esse, quam haec sunt, quae dici-
mus, ab initio res quem ad modum gesta sit, vobis ex—
ponemus, quo facilius et huius hominis innocentissimi
miserias et illorum audaciam cognoscere possitis et rei
publicae calamitatem.

My client's father, Sextus Roscius, was a citizen of A meria, of good
birth, wealth, and high connexions. He was a strong adherent
eff the nobility during the late disturbances. Unfortunately
he was on bad terms with his kinsmen, the two Titi Roscii,
Capito and fllagnus, who are men of the worst character. One
nzght he was murderea' in Rome, when returning from a
dinner. The news was brought in hot haste to Capito at
Ameria by a client of Magnus. W ithin fhur days Chryso·
gonus at Volaterrae was aware os the fact, and a conspiracy
was hatched between him and the Roscii. The name of the
murdered man was put on the list of the proscribed; his goods
were bought by Chrysogonus, who assigned three farms to
Capito, and sent Magnus as his agent to dis-possess my client of
his family estate. All this, I need scarcely say, was without
the knowledge of L. Sulla. So much sympathy was felt at
Ameria fhr my client, that a deputation was sent to lodge a
complaint with Sulla .· but it was rendered inefflctual by
collusion between Chrysogonus and Capito, who was himself
one of the deputies. My client then finding his life unsafie
took refuge with Caecilia ,· and his persecutors, havz'ngsaz'led
to murder him themselves, have brought this groundless, but
horrible charge of parricide against him, in order that you may
do it for them.
