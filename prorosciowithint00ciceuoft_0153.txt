PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧ 90.

greges? This incident made a lasting impression on the minds of
the Romans

a. quis ibi, etc. Part of a trochaic verse from Ennius' tragedy ξ 90,
of Achilles. The time referred to is when Hector burnt the ships of
the Greeks ; and the words are represented as spoken by Ulysses in
reply to a question from Ajax, asking him why he fied. The
Scholiast quotes them thus-—

‘ quis enim vulneratus ferro frugio‚'
and sees in the last word a reference to the impurities of Sulla—
‘ frugies autem dicuntur infames 'ma view which we may safely set
aside.

b. Curtios. Nothing is known of any accuser of the name of
Curtius. The employment of the plural when a name is used in a
generic sense is common in Latin. Cp. Verg. Geor. II. 169 ‘ Decios,
Marios magnosque Camillos,' where Servius remarks on the word
Camillos ‘abusive ε nam unus suit qui a Gallis sublata signa revocavit.'

c. Marios. Plutarch (Sulla 32) mentions that Catiline in the
effusion of his gratitude to Sulla for the post-mortem proscription of
his brother, cut off the head of a certain Marcus Marius, one of the
opposite party, and brought it to Sulla, as he sat in the forum. The
same story is told with revolting details in Livy Epit. 88, and in
Seneca's treatise De Ira (III. 18), where the murder is said to have
been perpetrated by Sulla’s orders. From a comparison of Seneca
with Pliny (N. H. XXXIII. 132, ed. Detl.) it appears that this was
Marius Gratidianus, whose bill for testing coinage had made him so
popular that statues were erected to him in every street. He was a
kinsman of Cicero's‚ being the son of M. Gratidius, whose sister was
Cicero's grandmother (De Leg. III, § 36). Cicero talks of him as a
turbulent demagogue (Brut. ξ 22 3).

d. Mammeos. Memmios has been suggested as a correction, from
Brut. ξ 136-‘ Tum etiam C. et L. Memmii fuerimt oratores medio-
cres, accusatores acres atque acerbi.’ Possibly Caius was dead at the
time referred to in the text (cp. Brut. ξ 304): but in any case the
plural is only rhetorical.

e. Priamum ipsum. The name of Priam is suggested by the
context simply as a type of age and dignity. It is out of keeping
with ‘ferro Phrygio.'

f Antistium. There is a Publius Antistius whose character as
a speaker is drawn by Cicero in the Brutus (55 226, 227). His
daughter, Antistia, was the first wife of Pompeius Magnus (Plut.
Pomp. 9), and owing to his being thus connected with the party of
Sulla, he was put to death by order of the younger Marius in B.c. 82,
