deicit ⁹) z but if Ovid meant ‘pontes’ in this sense, the explanation fails
to account for the custom. However that may be, the idea had
been started as early as the time of Varro that the common saying
‘sexagenarios de ponte deiciendos' had no reference to the drowning
of old men, but merely. to their ceasing to vote. See Nonius Mar-
cellus (p. 611, ed. Quicherat), ‘ Sexagenarz'os per pontem mittendos
male diu popularitas intellexit, quum Varro, de Vita populi Romani
lib. II. honestam causam religiosamque patefecerit ε “ Quum in
quintum gradum pervenerant, atque habebant sexaginta annos, tum
denique erant a publicis negotiis liberi atque otiosi. Ideo in pro—
verbium quidam putant venisse ut diceretur Sexagenarz‘os de ponte
dez‘z'cz‘ oportere, quod suffragium non ferant, quod per pontem fere-
bant.”' It seems to be peculiar to Varro to regard the sexagenarians
as being relieved from a duty instead of debarred from a privilege
(Cp. Macrob. Sat. I. 5 with the view of Sinnius Capito in Miiller's
Festus, p. 334).

Connected with the same idea is the phrase ‘depontani senes‚' which
is thus explained by Festus (p. 75)—‘dep0ntani senes appellabantur
qui sexagenarii de ponte deiciebantur.'

In the words before us Cicero evidently has in his mind the notion

of old men having really been flung into the Tiber, and affects to find
a violation of precedent in Capito’s treating in the same way a man
under sixty.
