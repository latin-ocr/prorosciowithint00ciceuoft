6 INTRODUCTJON.

ξ 3. Horrors of the Cz'vil War.

It is not Cicero's object in the speech before us to
exaggerate the horrors of the reign of terror, through which
Rome had just passed: but it is impossible for him to avoid
recalling them incidentally. For indeed Rome saw no days
more dark than these in her hundred years of strife, from
the moment when the blood of Tiberius Gracchus, the proto-
martyr of the civil wars‚ stained the slope of the Capitol
(B.c. 133) till the time when the furious sactions of the
world-ruling republic were crushed under the heel of des-
potism (B.C. 30). Nothing could have been more cruel, says a
Roman historian¹‚ than the victory of Marius, had it not
been sor the victory of Sulla. Let us set ourselves in
imagination at the point of time at,which that victory is
complete.

ξ 4. Merciless tyranny os Sulla.

The senate are met in the temple of Bellona, outside the
gates of the city, to inaugurate the return of order, when
they are scared in the midst of their deliberations by the
piercing shrieks of 6000 of the Italiam, who had borne arms
against Sulla, and who are now being butchered in cold
blood in the neighbouring Campus Martius2: but Sulla,
without moving a muscle of his face, bids the senators attend
to business, and not mind what was going on outside-—it
was only some rascals who were being ‘ admonished ⁹ by his
orders. Then even the dullest-witted of the Romans under-

stood that what had been accomplished by the victory was
only a change of tyrants.

2 In the ‘ villa publica‚’ Livy, Epit. 87 (cp. iv. 22). Livy states
the number to have been 8000. The story in the text is from

glritarch, Sulla, 30. Appiam, De Bell. Civ. i. 93, says ‘ more than
000.
