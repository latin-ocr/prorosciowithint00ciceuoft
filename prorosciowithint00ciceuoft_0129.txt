PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOT'ES. ᾧῷ 42—44.

b. mihi usu venit, ‘ Ῑ have experienced.'

c. inveniebat . . . reperire. There is no distinction intended
between these two words. ‘Reperire' is substituted in the second
clause merely for variety.

d. infirmem, ‘disprove.' It is the opposite of ‘confirmare‚'
which has just been used. In the De Inventione ‘ confirmatio ’ and
‘infirmatio ' are used severally for ‘ proof ’ and ‘ disproof.'

a. fructuosa, ‘productive'; to be distinguished from ‘fertilis.' ξ 43.
See Tusc. Disp. II, ξ 13—‘ ager quamvis fe1ti1is sine cultura fruc·
tuosus esse non potest.' Cp. ξ 20 f.

b. oolehda ac tuenda, ‘to cultivate and look after.’

c. Patres familias. The sing. of the second word was usual
in earlier Latin. Varro (L. L. viii, ξ 73) mentions the use of the
pl. as a peculiarity of Sisenna's; but by the time of Justinian it had
become habitual. The singular ‘familias’ must be taken distribu-
tively with ‘patres.' The word ‘ paterfamilias,’ which has practically
become English, is one of the oldest in the Latin language, as is
shown by the retention of the early genitive termination in -s‚
common to Greek and Latin. With ‘familia‚’ ‘ familias‘ ep. φιλία,
φιλίας.

d. municipiis rusticanis, ‘country towns.’ The word ‘rusti-
canus' (cp. §5 44, 75, 120) appears to be peculiar to Cicero in the
classical period of Latin. St. Jerome uses it, e.g. Epist. Sel. iv. ²4
(ed. Hurter).

a. ad villam. ‘ Ad villam ’ is not the same thing as ‘in villa' ; ᾗ 44,
but the ‘ad’ is used in much the same sense as our ‘at.’ When
we say ‘he is at his country house,' we do not necessarily imply
that he is in it. With this use of ‘ ad ’ may be compared ‘ ad saxa ’
in ξ 72, ‘ad regiam' Pro Mil. ξ 37, ‘ pugna ad Cannas, ad Trasu-
menum,' etc., and perhaps the expressions, ⁶ ad iudicem,' ‘ ad arbi-
trum‚' e. g. Pro Q. Rosc. Com. ᾖ 12—‘ quis umquam ad arbitrum,
quantum petiit tantum abstulit? ⁹ and in the next section—· ceteri
cum ad iudicem causam labefactari animadvertunt‚’ though here the
‘ad' may be a reminiscence of an original ‘adire’ or ‘venire.’
Asconius is clearly wrong in his interpretation of ‘ad urbem' in
Verr. i, 5 45—‘ Cn. Pompeius, cum primum concionem ad urbem
consul designatus habuit.’ He there explains it by ‘in urbe:
whereas ‘ outside the city ' would be nearer the truth. Pompey was
then awaiting his triumph, and could not enter.

‘Ad’ is also used for ‘ at the house of,' like the French ‘chez,'
e.g. Cat. I, ξ 19—‘ ad Μ’ Lepidum te habitare velle dixisti!

b. praediis . . . fundis. There is no antithesis between these
