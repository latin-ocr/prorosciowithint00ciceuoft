Ιι. adsequi . . . adepta. Mere synonyms.

a. missa faciam. Cp. ξ 76 ad in. ξ 132.

b. nuno cum maxime. ‘now as much as ever.' In full—‘tam
nunc fiunt quam cum maxime fiunt.’ ‘Cum maxime’ by itself is
sometimes used as a strong form of ‘nunc.' De InV. Ι, 5 39-ί quae
instent in praesentia et cum maxime fiunt.' Cp. Quint. VI. 1, ξ 23.

c. Erucius. After this word there follows a lacuna in the MSS.
The disjointed words which follow have been pieced together out of
the comments of the Scholiast; but the text of the Scholiast is
itself corrupt. The passage must have contained the revelation
of jobbery which Cicero declared he was about to make. See
ξ 127 ad fin.

α’. Panaoine. ‘The place where Roscius had been dining,’
Scholiast.

e. maxime metuit. ‘ Sullam scilicet.' Schol.

s. in Veientanam. It appears that Chrysogonus had transferred
some of the property of Roscius to a villa which he was building at
Veii—‘ hoc enim dicebat Chrysogonus. “ Non timui ne mihi toller-
entur bona Roscii, ideo eius praedia dissipavi, sed quia aedificabam
in Veientanam ideo de his transtuli.'’ '

g. manu praedia praediis. The Scholiast illustrates the use of
‘ manu ⁷ here by a phrase current in his own time—⁶ fac ad manum
illum codicem.' Cp. our ‘ handy.'

Ιι. hic ego, etc. With these words the orator effects a transition
to the final attack upon Chrysogonus.

i. aptam et ratione dispositam, ‘snug and well situated.’
Supply‘ villam' or ‘jdoxnum and cp. Hor. Carm. I. xii. 43—

‘apto
cum lare fundus?

j. in Salentinis. In Latin peoples are usually put for places;
in English the reverse. The Salentini were in Calabria.

a. tibi. Ethic dative. ‘You have the other coming down.’ §133-

‘'Alter refers to Chrysogonus in contrast with some less fortunate
land-holder.

b. Palatio. From being merely a fasbionable quarter of Rome
this became subsequently an imperial residence, and so gave' rise to
our word ‘ palace.’ Cicero himself had a house there later on,
which he bought from Crassus for about [30,000. ‘ De Palatio
et aedibus suis’ is a hendiadys=‘from his house on the Palatine.'
Cp. 5 129 a.

c. animi causa. Render here ‘ for relaxation.’ Cp. 5 134
ad in.
