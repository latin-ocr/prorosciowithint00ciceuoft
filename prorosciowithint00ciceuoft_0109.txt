d. relictus . . . restat. Notice the pleonasm. Cp. § 153 a.

e. illorum. Subjective genitive—‘ who is the sole survivor of the
atrocious massacre which those men have committed? On the
pronoun see ξ 8 c.

a. ea, quae facta sunt, etc„ ‘ that the facts themselves are more ξ 14,
shocking than my account of them.'

b. ab initio res, etc. The transition to the ‘ narratio ' is effected
in very similar words in the speech which we have extant from the
preceding year, Pro Q. ξ 11-‘ id quo facilius facere possitis, dabo
operam ut a principio res quem ad modum gesta et contracta sit
cognoscatis.’ Cp. also the corresponding passage in the Pro Milone,
ξ 2 3—‘ quod quo facilius argumentis perspicere possitis, rem gestam
vobis dum breviter expono, quaeso, diligenter attendite!

c. et rei publicae calamitatem. The aspect of the case which
makes it of special interest to the judges themselves is reserved for
the sake of emphasis to the end of the sentence, in the same way as

a. Sex. Roscius. The narratio in the Pro Cluentio, ξ 11, begins ᾗ 15,

b. Amerinus. Ameria was a small town in the south of Umbria,
between the Tiber and the Nar. It was fifty-six Roman miles from
the capital, ξ 19. Its inhabitants had been admitted to Roman

c. cum genere. The ‘ cum ' looks on to the ‘ tum ’ following-
· both . . . and?

d. nobilitate. This need not be taken in the technieal Roman

e. Metellis. Cp. § 77. From the days of Naevius downwards
the ‘ Metelli ' had been one of the leading families at Rome. They
were of plebeian origin, and belonged to the ‘gens Caecilia.' A
member of the family, Q. Metellus Pius, was consul along with
Sulla in this year (B.C. 80). So distinguished were they, that in the
time os this man's father, Q. Metellus Numidicus (consul B.C. 109),
the highest honours of the state were achieved twelve times within

consulship, censorship or triumph (Vell. Pat. II. 11‚'§ 3).

fi Serviliis. From their first adoption into the state by Tullus
