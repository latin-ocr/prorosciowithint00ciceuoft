PRO SEX. ROSCIO, NOTES. 5 ξξ 136-138.

d. defendisse, ‘stood out for.’ In the Academica Priora (ΙΙ, ξ 1 25)
Cicero says of himself playfully, ‘ semper enirn, ut scitis, studiosus
nobilitatis fui.’

e. humilitatem . . . contendere. Abstraet for concrete—‘ that
the contest was one between the low and the great‚' or, retaining the
words in brackets, ‘ that the low were contending with men of worth
for position.' A somewhat similar use of abstract terms occurs in
Pro Q. ᾗ 84--‘ in hac causa improbitatem et gratiam cum inopia et
veritate contendere.'

f. honorem et. gradum, ‘ office and rank.' Cp. ς 139—‘ sua
cuique procuratio auctoritasque est restituta.'

g. gaudeo . . . laetor. In his philosophical works Cicero explains
that ‘gaudium' signifies a more rational joy than ‘laetitia,’ e-g.
Tusc. Disp. IV, ξ, 13.

a. Quod animadversum est. Cp. the similar construction in
ξ 120 ‘ quod a vobis hoc pugnari video.’

b. non debeo reprehendere. We get Cicero's outspoken opinion
in the De Officiis 11, fi 27—‘ secuta est honestam causam non honesta
victoria.’ ‚

c. quorum opera, etc., ‘who have rendered signal aid,‘ i.e. the
soldiers of Sulla (‘ Sullani ’).

d. honos habitus est, ‘ have been rewarded.’ Cp. ᾖ 108 e. The
reward took the form of grants of land and houses in various parts of
Italy at the expenseof the adversaries (Appian, Bell. Civ. Ι, 96).

e. in eo studio partium fuisse, ‘that I favoured that side?

f. homines postremi, ‘ the lowest of mankind.’ Cp. Epist. ad
Brut. Ι. 16, ξ 3—‘ postremi homines.’ This use of ‘ postremus’ is
very rare in Cicero. But the word must have been in common use
in Latin in the sense of ‘ base} since we find a new comparative and
superlative formed from it in that sense. Thus C. Gracchus is quoted
by Aulus Gellius (XV. 1 2) as saying-‘omnium nationum (al. natorum)
postremissimum nequissimumque existimatote! And Apuleius de
Deo Socratis (ch. 3. Part 11. p. 121, ed. Hildebrand) has ‘ut possit
videri, nullum animal in terris homine postremius.’

g. non modo, etc. See 5 65 a.

Ιι. in isto bello. Addressed to the ‘iudices,’ who belonged to
the victorious party.

a. haee, ‘ the present state of things.'

b. nihil est. . . . dieat, ‘ there is no excuse for anyone being either
so foolish or so unprincipled as to say.’

c. hoe, ‘ so and so.‘ Cp. Ad H. II, 5 40—‘ nam hoc aut hoc
fecissem, sed me tum ratio fugit.’
