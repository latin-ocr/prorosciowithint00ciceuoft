PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ἕξ 48—50.

a. sis. A colloquial expression, contracted from ‘si vis,’ like
‘ sodes’ from ‘si audes ’ (Cic. Or. ξ 154). Cp. Pro Mil. 5 60-
‘cave, sis, mentiare'; De InV. Ι, § 51—‘ age sis‚’ inquit, and Livy
XXIII. 47, ξ 6—‘ Minime, sis, inquit, cantherium in fossam.’ It
occurs frequently in the comediam, and the reference to Caecilius
may have suggested it here. We find the pl. ‘ sultis ’ in Plautus.

b. in his veteribus municipiis, ‘in the old townships which
surround us‚' i. e. those nearer to Rome than Ameria was. ‘ Hic ’
denotes proximity of some kind to the speaker. Cp. ‘his moribus, '
which indicates proximity in time.

c. vitio et culpae dedisse, ‘turned what 1s the highest credit to
Sextus Roscius into a sault and charge against him.' Cp. 40 f We
have the same construction put absolutely below in ‘probro et
crimini . . . esse,' and followed by ‘ ad’ in ξ 149 ‘ad dicendum
impedimento est.’

d. vestrum. Subjective genitive, suggestive of the proposition,
‘ vos novistis.’ ‘ Vestri ’ would be impossible here.

e. quod . . . attinet, ‘as regards?

f. vitamque. Notice the unusual combination of ‘et' (before
‘ipsi '). and ‘ que‚’ which is perhaps due to the precedence of a pair
of ‘ et ’ clauses.

. a. Quid censes hune, etc. The subj. of the infin. clause which

follows has become the obj. of the interrogative clause on which it
depends. This constr. is regular in Greek, but rare in Latin.
Landgraf traces the present instance to an extension of such collo·
quial fonns as ‘ quid illum censes ’.ἱ ’ (Ter. And. 853). Cp. De Off.
II, ς 25—‘ quid enim censemus superiorem illum Dionysium quo
cruciatu timoris angi solitum . . . ’θ’

b. his. From this we may inser that his relations were present in
court. Cp. ξ 48 b.

c. deponat licebit, ‘he may lay aside for the future.‘ King.

d. obtinere. See 5 6 l.
e. hoe vero est, etc. ‘ But this is intolerable‚ that he has not

only been brought into this calamity on account of the excellence
and number of his farms, but also that the care with which he has
cultivated them is to prove mostly to his hurt, for sear there should
not be wretchedness enough in his having cultivated them sor others
instead of for himself, without his being accused for having cultivated

h m at all.’
t ea. Ne, ‘ verily.' Sometimes spelt ‘nae.' Mr. King says that in

Cicero this adverb is always coupled with a pronoun.
b. qui . . . fierent, ‘ to be made!
