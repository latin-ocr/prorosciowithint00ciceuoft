PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾧῷ 27, 28.

couneil of friends and relations. Valerius Maximus (II. 9, ξ 2)
records how the censors removed L. Antonius from the senate for
having divorced his wife without consulting his friends as to the
measure (⁶ nullo amicorum in consilium adhibito ').

b. Caeciliam. One of the powerful family of the Metelli. See
ξ 15 e.

c. Nepotis filiam. In § 147 she is explained to be ‘ Baliarici
filia, Nepotis soror.’ See note.

d. honoris eausa. See ξ 6 c.

e. qua pater usus erat plurimum, ‘ with whom his father had
been very intimate.’ So Verr. ii. I, 5 139—‘ eo sum usus plurimum3’
De Am. ς 2—‘ P. Sulpicio utebare multum?

f quasi exempli causa, ‘ as though to show us what it was?

g. antiqui offleii. Cp. Pro Q. ξ 59—‘ antiquam officii rationem -
dilexit, cuius splendor omnis his moribus obsolevit,’ and again ξ 7²
—‘ hominem antiqui officii.'

Ιι. hospiti. See § 15 h.

i. ut hic potius, etc. A double antithesis, which it is not easy
to keep up in English—‘that he lived to be accused, instead of being
murdered and proscribed‚’ i.e. entered on the list to hide the murder,
as Catiline entered his brother's name.

a. ut, nomen, etc. The three clauses commencing with ‘ ut ' are·⁴
epexegetical of ‘ consilium· The genitive of the gerund might
have been employed instead of them. Even a simple infinitive is
sometimes used, e. g. Pro Q. ξ 5 3 ad fin.—‘ eadem te hora consilium
cepisse, hominis propinqui fortunas funditus evertere.’

ὁ. nomen . . . deferrent. ‘ Nomen deferre' is the regular term
for lodging an accusation against some one. The accuser laid the
name before the praetor, under whose jurisdiction it came to take
eognisance of the charge, and the praetor, if he thought fit, entered
it on the list of accused. The praetor was said ‘nomen accipere'
(De Inv. 11, ς 58 ad fin.) or ‘ recipere ’ (Verr. ii. ΙΙ, ξ 94 ad fin.).
111 public trials, when rival accusers came forward‚ their claims had
to be argued in court (Ad H. I, ᾗ 22 ad fin.; Verr. Div. ξ Ιο).
This process was called ‘ divinatio? From ‘nomen deferre ' is
derived the name ‘ delator,’ which became os such sinister import
under the Empire, and the abstract term ‘ delatio.'

c. veterem. Cp. ξ 17 and §39 ‘vetus sicarius’ ; also the Teren·
tian use of‘ veterator’ (Andr. 457, Haut. 889) for‘ an old hand,’

‘a crafty fellow.'

d. de ea re, ‘on a matter? which is further defined by‘ in

qua re.'
