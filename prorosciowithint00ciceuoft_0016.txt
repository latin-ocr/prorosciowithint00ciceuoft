to be cajoled by Capito and Chrysogonus into coming away
without ever obtaining audience of Sulla. All they brought
with thern was a promise from Chrysogonus that the name
of Sextus Roscius, the father, should be taken off the pro-
scription-list‚ and that the farms should be evacuated, and
restored to the son. For the fulfilment· οξ this promise
Capito pledged his faith.

ξ 16. T he younger Sextus Roscius takes refitge with
Caecilia.

The promise however was far from being kept3 and the
son, feeling or fancying his life unsafe, fied to Rome, and
took refuge with a lady of high birth, who had been a
close friend of his father’s. This was Caecilia, daughter of
Q. Caecilius Metellus Baliaricus‚ and granddaughter of the
still more celebrated Macedonicus. She was second cousin
to Q. Metellus Pius, who was colleague in the consulship
with Sulla in B.C. 80, the year in which the speech Pro
Roscio was delivered, and also to her namesake, Caecilia
Metella, who had been the favoured wife of the dictator, but
who died in the same year in which the elder Roscius was
murdered (B.C. 81). Over the distressed and persecuted
outcast this noble lady threw the aegis of her protection with
the same intrepid constancy with which her kinsman
Numidicus had stood out alone against the turbulent power
of Saturninus.

ξ 17. Α charge of parricide brought against kim.

His enemies, enraged at finding themselves thus foiled,
had recourse to a design which could only have been suggested
by an overweening confidence of power. They tried to rid
themselves of the son by accusing him of his father’s murder,
and hoped to find an obedient bench of jurors who would
bring him in guilty of parricide. So sensational a charge

had in it all the elements of what we should call nowadays
a ‘ cause celebre?
