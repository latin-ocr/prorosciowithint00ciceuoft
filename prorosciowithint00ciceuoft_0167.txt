to a breach of trust, Cicero now goes on to assimilate it to a breach
of partnership. Under the former aspect the persons offended

{gainst were his sellow—townsmen‚ under this they are his fellow
eputies.

b. de quo ante dixi. See 5 111.

c. neque iniuria.. See ξ 17d.

d. qui . ‚ . . communicavit, ‘ who has entered into partnership
with another.’

e. per eius fidem. Cp. 5 110 ad f1n.—-‘ istius fide ac potius per-
fidia deceptus ;' De Inv. Ι, 5 71—‘ qui saepenumero nos per fidem
fefellerunt! In the same way ‘ valetudo ’ in Latin and ‘health’ in
English are used where what is really intended is the absence of that
attribute.

f Atque ea sunt, etc. This principle is based on the deterrent
theory of punishment, which regards it as inflicted for the good of
society, not for the sake of the person injured (the vindictive theory)
nor yet for the sake of the crimina] (the reformatory theory).

g. Tecti, ‘ guarded ’—a metaphor from gladiatorS.

a. muneris, etc„ ‘office‚ deputation, service, and commission.’ ξ 117,
Cicero is determined to show the copiousness of the language.

b. induxit, decepit, destituit. The climax here seems better
managed than in the ‘ decepit, fefellit, induxit' of the In Pisonem,
ξ 1, where, according to Aulus Gellius (XIII. 24) the words, though
tautological, produce a massive and rhythmical effect upon the ear.
‘Destituere ’ is ⁴ to leave in the lurch.' There is a corresponding
abstract term ‘ destitutio ' (Pro Q. ξ 20).

c. malitiam, ‘ knavishness.’ So above in ξ 111 ‘ malitiosius.’

d. proditor . . . perfuga. A man may be a traitor (‘ proditor ³)
in thought ε but his treachery is made apparent when he becomes a
deserter (‘ perfuga ').

e. terret ⁴. . . minatur, ‘ even intimidates us with threats.'

a. scelus . . . flagitia. ‘ Scelus ' is punishable by law3 ‘ flagi· ξ 118,
tium' is what violates the moral sense of mankind, whether it comes
within the scope of law or not. Cp. ξ 50 e.

b. promptum et propositum, ‘ glaring and obtrusive.'

c. si quod illorum, ‘ any of the others which.’ ‘ Si quis ‘ = ‘ any-
one who ;' ‘ si quod ' = ‘ anything which.’ The reading ‘ si quo de
illorum ’ is only an ingenious conjecture.

d. convincatur. In the De Inventione (11‚§§ 33, 34) Cicero
lays it down as a maxim that the more you blacken a man's char-
acter, the more you weaken his defence. So if there is anything to
be said against his previous career, you must bring it forward; if
