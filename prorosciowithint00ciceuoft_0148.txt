PRO SEX. ROSCIO. NOTES. ᾗῇ 78-80.

patema‚' if it were not for the ‘ de servis paternis ’ following, where
‘ de’ has a different sense.

c. dum . . . quaeratur, ‘ so long as to admit of an inquiry.’ The
subjunctive with ‘ dum ’ indicates a purpose.

d. neque ita multo post. See ξ 64 a.

. a. Liberosne. See ᾖ 74 b.

b. Quos neque, etc. ‘But you cannot show, etc.' It is common
to have a refutation thus introduced by a relative.

c. qua spe aut quo pretio. The two together make up one
idea—⁴ by what hope or bribe,’ so that they both come under the
last ‘ neque.’

d. multis annis, ‘for many years‚’ i. e. within the space of many
years. Cp. 5 74 d.

e. temere, ‘without grave reason.’

f servorum nomen, ‘ the mention of slaves!

g. reiectus a ceteris suspitionibus, ‘ when you found all other
surmises unavailing‚’ lit. ⁸ when you were cast off from,’ keeping up
the metaphor from a stom-tossed vessel.

Ιι. ubi, ‘ but here.' Cp. ‘quos neque ' above.

ί. ut non modo, etc„ ‘that you not merely see the charge
rebound from my client, but even become aware that all the
suspicion falls back upon yourselves.'

a. confugit. Present tense.

ξ 2)—‘ duo parietes de eadem fidelia dealbare,’ ‘to whitewash two
walls out of the same pail ’ = ‘to kill two birds with one stone?

c. nos iudicio perfundere, ‘to drench us with proceedings.’
Cicero implies that all that Erucius could do was to annoy his
client ; he could not hope for a verdict. The metaphor is probably
borrowed from the bath. Cp. Plat. Rep. 344 Β-ὥσπερ βαλανεὺς
ἡμῶν καταντλήσας κατὰ τῶν ὤτων ἀθρόον καὶ πολὺν τὸν λόγον.

d. sectoribus. A ‘ sector ’ was one who bought goods at a
public auction. Gaius IV, ᾖ 146—‘ sectores vocantur, qui publice
bona mercantur.’ The purchase of such goods was called ‘ sectio ⁹
(Tac. Ann. XIII. 23—‘ Paetus quidam, exercendis apud aerarium
sectionibus famosus ’), a term which is also applied by Caesar to the
goods themselves (Bell. Gall. ΙΙ. 33)—‘ sectionem eius oppidi uni-
versam Caesar vendidit.’

e. per ista tempora, ‘ during the times you speak of.' Referring
to the words of Erucius above—‘ eiusmodi tempus erat, etc?

f. sectores . . . bonorum. Cicero makes great capital out of the
