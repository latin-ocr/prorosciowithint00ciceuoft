accomplished pages, the pick of so many of the most fashionable
households—why they are scarcely above the level of common
labourers, from the training of a rustic householder at Ameria.' On
the household of Chrysogonus cp. what is said further on, ἓξ 133, 134.

J] omnium deliciarum. Descriptive genitive. Cp. ᾗ 17 ‘ plu-
rimarum palmarum.'

g. patris familiae. Here we have the ordinary form of the gen.

·of ‘ familia! See ξ 43 c.

a. veri simile. According to Halm (on Pro Sulla 5 57) this§ 121.
phrase takes ‘ut,’ only when a negative is expressed‚ as here, or
implied, as in Pro Sest. ξ 78 ad fin. Otherwise it has the acc. and
infin„ as in ξ 106.

b. adamarit, ‘ took a fancy to.'

c. quo studiosius, etc. Cp. 5 86 ad fin.——‘ atque eo magis
elucet, quo magis occultatur.’

a. distribuisse. The pres. infin. is more usual with ‘ memini.’ § 122.
But there is not much to choose between them. With the perfect
the meaning· is ‘You remember that I divided‚’ with the present
it would be ‘ You remember my dividing.’

b. initio. See ξ 35.

c. argumentatio. See ξ 97 Ιι.

α’. cuius partes, ‘ a rdle which.'

a. qui . . . velit, ‘ if one is willing.' ξ 123.’

b. verbo... re. Cp. Pro Q. ξ 56—‘haec ille, si verbis non
audet, re quidem vera palam loquitur.’ lt is like the standing
antithesis in Greek between λόγος and ἔργον.

c. initio. In beginning that part of his speech which was to deal
with the Roscii. See 5 83 ad fin.

d. coepero, ‘shall begin.’ The perfect being used as a present,
the future perfect is equivalent to a simple future.

a. nomen aureum. A pun on the name of Chrysogonus with§ 124.
allusion to his wealth. The Scholiast finds also in the words a
sneer at the servile origin of Chrysogonus, since such fancy names as
Smaragdus and Chrysogonus were often given to slaves. A slave of
the name Chrysogonus is mentioned in Verr. ii. Ι, ξ 92.

b. alii quoque plures. who, like Chrysogonus, had bought
confiscated goods.

c. in communem eausam sectorum, ‘against the general in-
terests of purchasers.' ⁸

a. sive Valeria est sive Cornelia. The ‘lex Valeria’ was§ 125.
passed by the praetor L. Valerius Flaccus, who was interrex in
B.c. 82. It provided that all Sulla’s measures should have the force
